  <p><span class="sc">Dear Mr. Smithers,</span></p>

  <p>By every right I ought to choose you to edit and bring out Sir Richard
  Burton's translation of Catullus, because you collaborated with him on
  this work by a correspondence of many months before he died. If I have
  hesitated so long as to its production, it was because his notes, which
  are mostly like pencilled cobwebs, strewn all over his Latin edition,
  were headed, "<span class="scac">NEVER SHEW HALF-FINISHED WORK TO WOMEN
  OR FOOLS</span>." The reason of this remark was, that in all his
  writings, his first copy, his first thought, was always the best and the
  most powerful. Like many a painter who will go on improving and touching
  up his picture till he has destroyed the likeness, and the startling
  realistic nature of his subject, so would Sir Richard go on weakening his
  first copy by improvements, and then appeal to me to say which was the
  best. I was almost invariably obliged, in conscience, to induce him to
  stick to the first thought, which had grasped the whole meaning like a
  flash. These notes were made in a most curious way. He used to bring his
  Latin Catullus down to <i>table d'hôte</i> with him, and he used to come
  and sit by me, but the moment he got a person on the other side, who did
  not interest him, he used to whisper to me, "Talk, <!-- Page vi --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="pagevi"></a>[vi]</span>that I may do my
  Catullus," and between the courses he wrote what I now give you. The
  public school-boy is taught that the Atys was unique in subject and
  metre, that it was the greatest and most remarkable poem in Latin
  literature, famous for the fiery vehemence of the Greek dithyramb, that
  it was the only specimen in Latin of the Galliambic measure, so called,
  because sung by the Gallæ&mdash;and I suspect that the school-boy now
  learns that there are half a dozen others, which you can doubtless name.
  To <i>my</i> mind the gems of the whole translation are the Epithalamium
  or Epos of the marriage of Vinia and Manlius, and the Parcae in that of
  Peleus and Thetis. Sir Richard laid great stress on the following in his
  notes, headed "Compare with Catullus, the sweet and tender little
  Villanelle, by Mr. Edmund Gosse," for the Viol and Flute&mdash;the XIX
  cent. with the I<sup>st.</sup></p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">

    <div class="stanza">
<!-- Page vii --><span class="pagenum"><a name="pagevii"></a>[vii]</span>
      <p>That I still may feel you nigh,</p>

      <p>Dig my grave, for I must die.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">

      <p class="i2">Be the mourners, fit and few.</p>

      <p class="i2">Dig my grave, for I must die."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Sir Richard seriously began his Catullus on Feb. 18th, 1890, at Hamman
  R'irha, in North Africa. He had finished the first rough copy on March
  31st, 1890, at Trieste. He made a second copy beginning May 23rd, 1890,
  at Trieste, which was finished July 21st, 1890, at Zurich. He then writes
  a margin. "Work incomplete, but as soon as I receive Mr. Smithers' prose,
  I will fill in the words I now leave in stars, in order that we may not
  use the same expressions, and I will then make a third, fair, and
  complete copy." But, alas! then he was surprised by Death.</p>

  <p>I am afraid that Sir Richard's readers may be disappointed to find
  that, unlike Mr. Grant Allen, there is no excursus on the origin of
  Tree-worship, and therefore that, perhaps, through ignorance, I have
  omitted something. Sir Richard did write in the sixties and seventies on
  Tree-alphabets, the Ogham Runes and El Mushajjar, the Arabic
  Tree-alphabet,&mdash;and had theories and opinions as to its origin; but
  he did not, I know, connect them in any way, however remote, with
  Catullus. I therefore venture to think you will quite agree with me, <!--
  Page viii --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="pageviii"></a>[viii]</span>that they have no business here, but
  should appear in connection with my future work, "Labours and Wisdom of
  Sir Richard Burton."</p>

  <p>All these three and a half years, I have hesitated what to do, but
  after seeing other men's translations, his <i>incomplete</i> work is, in
  my humble estimation, too good to be consigned to oblivion, so that I
  will no longer defer to send you a type-written copy, and to ask you to
  bring it through the press, supplying the Latin text, and adding thereto
  your own prose, which we never saw.</p>

<p class="cenhead">Yours truly,</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Isabel Burton.</span>

<h3>FOREWORD</h3>

  <p>A scholar lively, remembered to me, that <i>Catullus</i> translated
  word for word, is an anachronism, and that a literal English rendering in
  the nineteenth century could be true to the poet's letter, but false to
  his spirit. I was compelled to admit that something of this is true; but
  it is not the whole truth. "Consulting modern taste" means really a mere
  imitation, a re-cast of the ancient past in modern material. It is
  presenting the toga'd citizen, rough, haughty, and careless of any
  approbation not his own, in the costume of to-day,&mdash;boiled shirt,
  dove-tailed coat, black-cloth clothes, white pocket-handkerchief, and
  diamond ring. Moreover, of these transmogrifications we have already
  enough and to spare. But we have not, as far as I know, any version of
  Catullus which can transport the English reader from the teachings of our
  century to that preceding the Christian Era. As discovery is mostly my
  mania, I have hit upon a bastard-urging to indulge it, by a presenting to
  the public of certain classics in the nude Roman poetry, like the Arab,
  and of the same date....</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>A 'cute French publisher lately remarked to me that, as a rule,
  versions in verse are as enjoyable to the writer as they are unenjoyed by
  the reader, who vehemently doubts their truth and trustworthiness. These
  pages hold in view one object sole and simple, namely, to prove that a
  translation, metrical and literal, may be true and may be
  trustworthy.</p>

  <p>As I told the public (Camoens: Life and Lusiads ii. 185-198), it has
  ever been my ambition to reverse the late Mr. Matthew Arnold's peremptory
  dictum:&mdash;"In a verse translation no original work is any longer
  recognisable." And here I may be allowed to borrow from my Supplemental
  Arabian Nights (Vol. vi., Appendix pp. 411-412, a book known to few and
  never to be reprinted) my vision of the ideal translation which should
  not be relegated to the Limbus of Intentions.</p>

  <p>"My estimate of a translator's office has never been of the low level
  generally assigned to it even in the days when Englishmen were in the
  habit of translating every work, interesting or important, published out
  of England, and of thus giving a continental and cosmopolitan flavour to
  their literature. We cannot at this period expect much from a 'man of
  letters' who must produce a monthly volume for a pittance of £20: of him
  we need not speak. But the translator at his best, works, when
  reproducing the matter and the manner of his original, upon two distinct
  lines. His prime and primary object is to please his reader, edifying him
  and gratifying his <!-- Page xi --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="pagexi"></a>[xi]</span>taste; the second is to produce an honest
  and faithful copy, adding naught to the sense or abating aught of its
  especial <i>cachet</i>. He has, however, or should have, another aim
  wherein is displayed the acme of hermeneutic art. Every language can
  profitably lend something to and take somewhat from its
  neighbours&mdash;an epithet, a metaphor, a naïf idiom, a turn of phrase.
  And the translator of original mind who notes the innumerable shades of
  tone, manner and complexion will not neglect the frequent opportunities
  of enriching his mother-tongue with novel and alien ornaments which shall
  justly be accounted barbarisms until formally naturalized and adopted.
  Nor will any modern versionist relegate to a foot-note, as is the
  malpractice of his banal brotherhood, the striking and often startling
  phases of the foreign author's phraseology and dull the text with
  well-worn and commonplace English equivalents, thus doing the clean
  reverse of what he should do. It was this <i>beau idéal</i> of a
  translator's success which made Eustache Deschamps write of his
  contemporary and brother bard,</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p><i>Grand Translateur, noble Geoffroy Chaucier.</i></p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Here</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>'The firste finder of our fair langage'</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>is styled 'a Socrates in philosophy, a Seneca in morals, an Angel in
  conduct and a great Translator,'&mdash;a seeming anti-climax which has
  scandalized not a little sundry inditers of 'Lives' and 'Memoirs.' The
  title is no bathos: it is given simply because Chaucer <i>translated</i>
  (using the term in its best and highest sense) into his pure, simple and
  strong English tongue with all its linguistic peculiarities, the thoughts
  and fancies of his foreign models, the very letter and spirit of Petrarch
  and Boccaccio."</p>

  <p>For the humble literary status of translation in modern England and
  for the short-comings of the <!-- Page xii --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="pagexii"></a>[xii]</span>average English translator, public taste
  or rather caprice is mainly to be blamed. The "general reader," the man
  not in the street but the man who makes up the educated mass, greatly
  relishes a novelty in the way of "plot" or story or catastrophe while he
  has a natural dislike to novelties of style and diction, demanding a
  certain dilution of the unfamiliar with the familiar. Hence our
  translations in verse, especially when rhymed, become for the most part
  deflorations or excerpts, adaptations or periphrases more or less
  meritorious and the "translator" was justly enough dubbed "traitor" by
  critics of the severer sort. And he amply deserves the injurious name
  when ignorance of his original's language perforce makes him pander to
  popular prescription.</p>

  <p>But the good time which has long been coming seems now to have come.
  The home reader will no longer put up with the careless caricatures of
  classical chefs d'&oelig;uvre which satisfied his old-fashioned
  predecessor. Our youngers, in most points our seniors, now expect the
  translation not only to interpret the sense of the original but also,
  when the text lends itself to such treatment, to render it <i>verbatim et
  literatim</i>, nothing being increased or diminished, curtailed or
  expanded. Moreover, in the choicer passages, they so far require an echo
  of the original music that its melody and harmony should be suggested to
  their mind. Welcomed also are the mannerisms of the translator's model as
  far as these aid in preserving, under the disguise of another dialect,
  the individuality of the foreigner and his peculiar costume.</p>

  <p>That this high ideal of translation is at length becoming popular now
  appears in our literature. The "Villon Society," when advertizing the
  novels of Matteo Bandello, Bishop of Agen, justly remarks of the
  translator, Mr. John Payne, that his previous works have proved him to
  possess special qualifications for "the delicate and difficult task of
  transferring into his own <!-- Page xiii --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="pagexiii"></a>[xiii]</span>language at once the savour and the
  substance, the matter and the manner of works of the highest
  individuality, conceived and executed in a foreign language."</p>

  <p>In my version of hexameters and pentameters I have not shirked the
  metre although it is strangely out of favour in English literature while
  we read it and enjoy it in German. There is little valid reason for our
  aversion; the rhythm has been made familiar to our ears by long courses
  of Greek and Latin and the rarity of spondaic feet is assuredly to be
  supplied by art and artifice.</p>

  <p>And now it is time for farewelling my friends:&mdash;we may no longer
  (alas!) address them, with the ingenuous Ancient in the imperative</p>

<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>

  <p>The present translation was jointly undertaken by the late Sir Richard
  Burton and myself in 1890, some months before his sudden and lamented
  death. We had previously put into English, and privately printed, a body
  of verse from the Latin, and our aim was to follow it with literal and
  unexpurgated renderings of Catullus, Juvenal, and Ausonius, from the same
  tongue. Sir Richard laid great stress on the necessity of thoroughly
  annotating each translation from an erotic (and especially a paederastic)
  point of view, but subsequent circumstances caused me to abandon that
  intention.</p>

  <p>The Latin text of Catullus printed in this volume is that of Mueller
  (<span class="scac">A.D.</span> 1885), which Sir Richard Burton chose as
  the basis for our translation, and to that text I have mainly adhered. On
  some few occasions, however, I have slightly deviated from it, and,
  although I have consulted Owen and Postgate, in such cases I have usually
  followed Robinson Ellis.</p>

  <p>Bearing in mind my duty to the reader as well as to the author, I have
  aimed at producing a readable translation, and yet as literal a version
  (castrating no passages) as the dissimilarity in idiom of the two <!--
  Page xvi --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="pagexvi"></a>[xvi]</span>languages, Latin and English, permit; and
  I claim for this volume that it is the first literal and complete English
  translation as yet issued of Catullus. The translations into English
  verse which I have consulted are <i>The Adventures of Catullus, and the
  History of his Amours with Lesbia</i> (done from the French, 1707), Nott,
  Lamb, Fleay, (privately printed, 1864), Hart-Davies, Shaw, Cranstoun,
  Martin, Grant Allen, and Ellis. Of these, none has been helpful to me
  save Professor Robinson Ellis's <i>Poems and Fragments of Catullus
  translated in the metres of the original</i>,&mdash;a most excellent and
  scholarly version, to which I owe great indebtedness for many a
  felicitous expression. I have also used Dr. Nott freely in my
  annotations. The only English prose translation of which I have any
  knowledge is the one in Bohn's edition of Catullus, and this, in addition
  to being bowdlerized, is in a host of passages more a paraphrase than a
  literal translation.</p>

  <p>I have not thought it needful in any case to point out my deviations
  from Mueller's text, and I have cleared the volume of all the load of
  mythological and historical notes which are usually appended to a
  translation of a classic, contenting myself with referring the
  non-classical reader to Bohn's edition of the poet.</p>

  <p>Of the boldness of Sir Richard Burton's experiment of a metrical and
  linear translation there can be no question; and on the whole he has
  succeeded <!-- Page xvii --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="pagexvii"></a>[xvii]</span>in proving his contention as to its
  possibility, though it must be confessed that it is at times at the cost
  of obscurity, or of inversions of sentences which certainly are compelled
  to lay claim to a poet's license. It must, however, be borne in mind that
  in a letter to me just before his death, he expressed his intention of
  going entirely through the work afresh, on receiving my prose, adding
  that it needed "a power of polishing."</p>

  <p>To me has fallen the task of editing Sir Richard's share in this
  volume from a type-written copy literally swarming with copyist's errors.
  With respect to the occasional lacunae which appear, I can merely state
  that Lady Burton has repeatedly assured me that she has furnished me with
  a faithful copy of her husband's translation, and that the words omitted
  (which are here indicated by full points, not asterisks) were <i>not</i>
  filled in by him, because he was first awaiting my translation with the
  view of our not using similar expressions. However, Lady Burton has
  without any reason consistently refused me even a glance at his MS.; and
  in our previous work from the Latin I did not find Sir Richard trouble
  himself in the least concerning our using like expressions.</p>

  <p>The frontispiece to this volume is reproduced from the statue which
  stands over the Palazzo di Consiglio, the Council House at Verona, which
  is the only representation of Catullus extant.</p>

  well as damsel knoweth her own mother nor from her bosom did it rove, but
  hopping round first one side then the other, to its mistress alone it
  evermore did chirp. Now does it fare along that path of shadows whence
  naught may e'er return. Ill be to ye, savage glooms of Orcus, which
  swallow up all things of fairness: which have snatched away from me the
  comely sparrow. O deed of bale! O sparrow sad of plight! Now on thy

      <p>Saith she was erstwhile fleetest-fleet of crafts,</p>

      <p>Cognisant were ye, and you weet full well</p>
      <div class="linenum">15</div><p>(So saith my Pinnace) how from earliest age</p>
      <p>Upon your highmost-spiring peak she stood,</p>
      <p>How in your waters first her sculls were dipt,</p>
      <p>And thence thro' many and many an important strait</p>
      <p>She bore her owner whether left or right,</p>
      <div class="linenum">20</div><p>Where breezes bade her fare, or Jupiter deigned</p>
      <p>At once propitious strike the sail full square;</p>
      <p>Nor to the sea-shore gods was aught of vow</p>

      <p>Extreme she voyaged for this limpid lake.</p>
      <div class="linenum">25</div><p>Yet were such things whilome: now she retired</p>

  <p>That pinnace which ye see, my friends, says that it was the speediest
  of boats, nor any craft the surface skimming but it could gain the lead,
  whether the course were gone o'er with plashing oars or bended sail. And
  this the menacing Adriatic shores may not deny, nor may the Island
  Cyclades, nor noble Rhodes and bristling Thrace, Propontis nor the gusty
  Pontic gulf, where itself (afterwards a pinnace to become) erstwhile was
  a foliaged clump; and oft on Cytorus' ridge hath this foliage announced
  itself in vocal rustling. And to thee, Pontic Amastris, and to
  box-screened Cytorus, the pinnace vows that this was alway and yet is of
  common knowledge most notorious; states that from its primal being it
  stood upon thy topmost peak, dipped its oars in thy waters, and bore its
  master thence through surly seas of number frequent, whether the wind
  whistled 'gainst the starboard quarter or the lee or whether Jove
  propitious fell on both the sheets at once; nor any vows [from stress of
  storm] to shore-gods were ever made by it when coming from the uttermost
  seas unto this glassy lake. But these things were of time gone by: now
  laid away, it rusts in peace and dedicates its age to thee, twin Castor,
  and to Castor's twin.</p>

  <p>Varus drew me off to see his mistress as I was strolling from the
  Forum: a little whore, as it seemed to me at the first glance, neither
  inelegant nor lacking good looks. When we came in, we fell to discussing
  various subjects, amongst which, how was Bithynia now, how things had
  gone there, and whether I had made any money there. I replied, what was
  true, that neither ourselves nor the praetors nor their suite had brought
  away anything whereby to flaunt a better-scented poll, especially as our
  praetor, the irrumating beast, cared not a single hair for his suite.
  "But surely," she said, "you got some men to bear your litter, for they
  are said to grow there?" I, to make myself appear to the girl as one of
  the fortunate, "Nay," I say, "it did not go that badly with me, ill as
  the province turned out, that I could not procure eight strapping knaves
  to bear me." (But not a single one was mine either here or there who the
  fractured foot of my old bedstead could hoist on his neck.) And she, like
  a pathic girl, "I pray thee," says she, "lend me, my Catullus, those
  bearers for a short time, for I wish to be borne to the shrine of
  Serapis." "Stay," quoth I to the girl, "when I said I had this, my tongue
  slipped; my friend, Cinna Gaius, he provided himself with these. In
  truth, whether his or mine&mdash;what do I trouble? I use them as though
  I had paid for them. But thou, in ill manner with foolish teasing dost
  not allow me to be heedless." <!-- Page 20 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  gift, Sulla, the litterateur, gives thee, it is not ill to me, but well
  and beatific, that thy labours [in his cause] are not made light of.
  Great gods, what a horrible and accurst book which, forsooth, thou hast
  sent to thy Catullus that he might die of boredom the livelong day in the
  Saturnalia, choicest of days! No, no, my joker, this shall not leave thee
  so: for at daydawn I will haste to the booksellers' cases; the Caesii,
  the Aquini, Suffenus, every poisonous rubbish will I collect that I may
  repay thee with these tortures. Meantime (farewell ye) hence depart ye

  that,&mdash;didst thine heart long for aught, which thou desiredst chaste
  and untouched,&mdash;thou 'lt preserve for me the chastity of my boy. I
  do not say from the public: I fear those naught who hurry along the
  thoroughfares hither thither occupied on their own business: truth my
  fear is from thee and thy penis, pestilent eke to fair and to foul. Set
  it in motion where thou dost please, whenever thou biddest, as much as
  thou wishest, wherever thou findest the opportunity out of doors: this
  one object I except, to my thought a reasonable boon. But if thy evil
  mind and senseless rutting push thee forward, scoundrel, to so great a
  crime as to assail our head with thy snares, O wretch, calamitous mishap

  be pitched in the sludge head over heels, right where the lake of all its
  stinking slime is dankest and most superfluent&mdash;a deep-sunk abyss.
  The man is a gaping gaby! lacking the sense of a two-years-old baby
  dozing on its father's cradling arm. Although to him is wedded a girl
  flushed with springtide's bloom (and a girl more dainty than a tender
  kid, meet to be watched with keener diligence than the lush-black
  grape-bunch), he leaves her to sport at her list, cares not a single
  hair, nor bestirs himself with marital office, but lies as an alder
  felled by Ligurian hatchet in a ditch, as sentient of everything as
  though no woman were at his side. Such is my booby! he sees not, he hears
  naught. Who himself is, or whether he be or be not, he also knows not.
  Now I wish to chuck him head first from thy bridge, so as to suddenly
  rouse (if possible) this droning dullard and to leave behind in the
  sticky slush his sluggish spirit, as a mule casts its iron shoe in the
  tenacious slough.</p>

  <p>I, O traveller, shaped with rustic art from a dry poplar, guard this
  little field which thou seest on the left, and the cottage and small
  garden of its indigent owner, and keep off the greedy hands of the
  robber. In spring a many-tinted wreath is placed upon me; in summer's
  heat ruddy grain; [in autumn] a luscious grape cluster with vine-shoots,
  and in the bitter cold the pale-green olive. The tender she-goat bears
  from my pasture to the town milk-distended udders; the well-fattened lamb
  from my sheepfolds sends back [its owner] with a heavy handful of money;
  and the tender calf, 'midst its mother's lowings, sheds its blood before
  the temple of the Gods. Hence, wayfarer, thou shalt be in awe of this
  God, and it will be profitable to thee to keep thy hands off. For a
  punishment is prepared&mdash;a roughly-shaped mentule. "Truly, I am
  willing," thou sayest; then, truly, behold the farmer comes, and that
  same mentule plucked from my groin will become an apt cudgel in his
  strong right hand.</p>

      <p>Methinks he fathers thousands ten or more</p>
      <div class="linenum">5</div><p>Indited not as wont on palimpsest,</p>
      <p>But paper-royal, brand-new boards, and best</p>
      <p>Fresh bosses, crimson ribbands, sheets with lead</p>
      <p>Ruled, and with pumice-powder all well polished.</p>
      <p>These as thou readest, seem that fine, urbane</p>
      <div class="linenum">10</div><p>Suffenus, goat-herd mere, or ditcher-swain</p>

      <p>He now in dullness, dullest villain beats</p>
      <div class="linenum">15</div><p>Forthright on handling verse, nor is the wight</p>
      <p>Ever so happy as when verse he write:</p>

  <p>That Suffenus, Varus, whom thou know'st right well, is a man fair
  spoken, witty and urbane, and one who makes of verses lengthy store. I
  think he has writ at full length ten thousand or more, nor are they set
  down, as of custom, on palimpsest: regal paper, new boards, unused
  bosses, red ribands, lead-ruled <!-- Page 45 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page45"></a>[45]</span>parchment, and all most evenly pumiced. But
  when thou readest these, that refined and urbane Suffenus is seen on the
  contrary to be a mere goatherd or ditcher-lout, so great and shocking is
  the change. What can we think of this? he who just now was seen a
  professed droll, or e'en shrewder than such in gay speech, this same
  becomes more boorish than a country boor immediately he touches poesy,
  nor is the dolt e'er as self-content as when he writes in verse,&mdash;so
  greatly is he pleased with himself, so much does he himself admire.
  Natheless, we all thus go astray, nor is there any man in whom thou canst
  not see a Suffenus in some one point. Each of us has his assigned
  delusion: but we see not what's in the wallet on our back.</p>

  followed a praetor, inscribed more gifts than gains. "O Memmius, well and
  slowly didst thou irrumate me, supine, day by day, with the whole of that

  <p>That thou mightst be Queen of lofty mounts, of foliaged groves, of
  remote glens, and of winding streams.</p>

  <p>Thou art called Juno Lucina by the mother in her travail-pangs, thou
  art named potent Trivia and Luna with an ill-got light.</p>

  <p>Thou, Goddess, with monthly march measuring the yearly course, dost
  glut with produce the rustic roofs of the farmer.</p>

  <p>Be thou hallowed by whatsoe'er name thou dost prefer; and cherish,
  with thine good aid, as thou art wont, the ancient race of Romulus.</p>

  that he hie him here to Verona, quitting New Comum's city-walls and
  Larius' shore; for I wish him to give ear to certain counsels from a

  although a milk-white maid doth thousand times retard his going, and
  flinging both arms around his neck doth supplicate delay&mdash;a damsel
  who now, if truth be brought me, is undone with immoderate love of him.
  For, since what time she first read of the Dindymus Queen, flames devour
  the innermost marrow of the wretched one. I grant thee pardon, damsel,
  more learned than the Sapphic muse: for charmingly has the Mighty Mother
  been sung by Caecilius.</p>

      <p>So I might talk wi' thee, and be wi' thee.</p>
      <p>But when these wearied limbs from labour free</p>
      <div class="linenum">15</div><p>Were on my couchlet strewn half-dead to lie,</p>

  upon my tablets, as became us, men <!-- Page 90 --><span

  versicles in turn sported first in this metre then in that, exchanging
  mutual epigrams 'midst jokes and wine. But I departed thence, afire,
  Licinius, with thy wit and drolleries, so that food was useless to my
  wretched self; nor could sleep close mine eyes in quiet, but all o'er the
  bed in restless fury did I toss, longing to behold daylight that with
  thee I might speak, and again we might be together. But afterwards, when
  my limbs, weakened by my restless labours, lay stretched in semi-death
  upon the bed, this poem, O jocund one, I made for thee, from which thou
  mayst perceive my dolour. Now 'ware thee of presumptuousness, and our
  pleadings 'ware thee of rejecting, we pray thee, eye-babe of ours, lest
  Nemesis exact her dues from thee. She is a forceful Goddess; 'ware her

  In promenade yclept "The Great," the crowd of cocottes straightway did I
  stop, O friend, accosting those whose looks I noted were unruffled. And
  for thee loudly did I clamour, "Restore to me Camerius, most giddy
  girls." Quoth such-an-one, her bosom bare a-shewing, "Look! 'twixt
  rose-red paps he shelters him." But labour 'tis of Hercules thee now to
  find. Not were I framed the Cretan guard, nor did I move with Pegasean
  wing, nor were I Ladas, or Persius with the flying foot, or Rhesus with
  swift and snowy team: to these add thou the feathery-footed and winged
  ones, ask likewise fleetness of the winds: which all united, O Camerius,
  couldst thou me grant, yet exhausted in mine every marrow and with many a
  faintness consumed should I be in my quest for thee, O friend. Why
  withdraw thyself in so much pride, O friend? Tell us where thou wilt be
  found, declare it boldly, give up the secret, trust it to the light.
  What, do the milk-white maidens hold thee? If <!-- Page 98 --><span

  closed up in mouth, thou squanderest Love's every fruit: for Venus joys
  in many-worded babblings. Yet if thou wishest, thou mayst bar thy palate,
  if I may be a sharer in thy love.</p>

  <p>O Fosterer of the Helicon Hill, sprung from Urania, who beareth the
  gentle virgin to her mate, O Hymenaeus Hymen, O Hymen Hymenaeus!</p>

  <p>Twine round thy temples sweet-smelling flowerets of marjoram; put on
  thy gold-tinted veil; light-hearted, hither, hither haste, bearing on
  snowy foot the golden-yellow sandal: <!-- Page 120 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page120"></a>[120]</span></p>

  <p>And a-fire with the joyous day, chanting wedding melodies with ringing
  voice, strike the ground with thy feet, with thine hand swing aloft the
  pine-link.</p>

  <p>For Vinia&mdash;fair as Idalian Venus, when stood before the Phrygian
  judge&mdash;a virgin fair, weds Manlius 'midst happy auspices.</p>

  <p>She, bright-shining as the Asian myrtle florid in branchlets, which
  the Hamadryads nurture for their pleasure with besprinkled dew.</p>

  <p>Wherefore, hither! leaving the Aonian grot in the Thespian Rock, o'er
  which flows the chilling stream of Aganippe.</p>

  <p>And summon homewards the mistress, eager for her new yoke,
  firm-prisoning her soul in love; as tight-clasping ivy, wandering hither,
  thither, enwraps the tree around.</p>

  <p>And also ye, upright virgins, for whom a like day is nearing, chant ye
  in cadence, singing "O Hymenaeus Hymen, O Hymen Hymenaeus!"</p>

  <p>That more freely, hearing himself to his duty called, will he bear
  hither his presence, Lord of true Venus, uniter of true lovers.</p>

  <p>What god is worthier of solicitation by anxious amourists? Whom of the
  celestials do men worship more greatly? O Hymenaeus Hymen, O Hymen
  Hymenaeus!</p>

  <p>Thee for his young the trembling father beseeches, for thee virgins
  unclasp the zone from their breasts, for thee the fear-full bridegroom
  harkeneth with eager ear. <!-- Page 121 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page121"></a>[121]</span></p>

  <p>Thou bearest to the youngster's arms that flower-like damsel, taken
  from her mother's bosom, O Hymenaeus Hymen, O Hymen Hymenaeus!</p>

  <p>Nor lacking thee may Venus take her will with fair Fame's approbation;
  but she may, with thy sanction. With such a God who dares compare?</p>

  <p>Lacking thee, no house can yield heirs, nor parent be surrounded by
  offspring; but they may, with thy sanction. With such a God who dares
  compare?</p>

  <p>Nor lacking thy rites may our land be protected e'en to its
  boundaries; but it may, with thy sanction. With such a God who dares
  compare?</p>

  <p>Gates open wide: the virgin is here. See how the torch-flakes shake
  their gleaming locks? Let shame retard the modest:</p>

  <p>Yet hearing, greater does she weep, that she must onwards go.</p>

  <p>Cease thy tears. For thee there is no peril, Aurunculeia, that any
  woman more beauteous from Ocean springing shall ever see the light of
  day.</p>

  <p>Thou art like the hyacinthine flower, wont to stand aloft 'midst
  varied riches of its lordling's garden. But thou delayest, day slips by:
  advance, new mated one.</p>

  <p>Advance, new mated, now in sight, and listen to our speech. Note how
  the torch-flakes shake their glittering tresses: advance, new mated
  one.</p>

  <p>Nor given to ill adulteries, nor seeking lawless shames, shall thy
  husband ever wish to lie away from thy soft breasts, <!-- Page 122
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page122"></a>[122]</span></p>

  <p>But as the lithe vine amongst neighbouring trees doth cling, so shall
  he be enclasped in thine encircled arms. But day slips by: advance, new
  mated one.</p>

  <p>O nuptial couch * * * * with feet of ivory white.</p>

  <p>What joys are coming to thy lord, in gloom o' night, in noon of day.
  Let him rejoice! but day slips by: advance, new mated one.</p>

  <p>High raise, O boys, the torches: I see the gleaming veil approach.
  Come, chant in cadence, "O Hymen Hymenaeus io, O Hymen Hymenaeus."</p>

  <p>Nor longer silent is lewd Fescinnine jest, nor to the boys the nuts
  deny, ingle, hearing thy master's love has flown.</p>

  <p>Give nuts to the boys, O listless ingle; enough of days thou hast
  played with nuts: now 'tis meet to serve Talassius. O ingle, give the
  nuts!</p>

  <p>The country lasses slighted were by thee, O ingle, till to-day: now
  the bride's tiresman shaves thy face. Wretched, wretched ingle, give the
  nuts.</p>

  <p>They say that from thy hairless ingles, O sweet-scented bridegroom,
  thou canst scarce abstain: but abstain thou! O Hymen Hymenaeus io, O
  Hymen Hymenaeus.</p>

  <p>We know that these delights were known to thee only when lawful: but
  to the wedded these same no more are lawful. O Hymen Hymenaeus io, O
  Hymen Hymenaeus! <!-- Page 123 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page123"></a>[123]</span></p>

  <p>Thou also, bride, what thy husband seekest beware of denying, lest he
  go elsewhere in its search. O Hymen Hymenaeus io, O Hymen Hymenaeus!</p>

  <p>Look, thy husband's home is thine, potent and goodly, and shall be
  thine for ever more. O Hymen Hymenaeus io, O Hymen Hymenaeus!</p>

  <p>Until with trembling movement thine hoary brow nods ever to
  everything. O Hymen Hymenaeus io, O Hymen Hymenaeus!</p>

  <p>Lift o'er the threshold with good omen thy glistening feet, and go
  through the polished gates. O Hymen Hymenaeus io, O Hymen Hymenaeus!</p>

  <p>Look! thy lord within, lying on Tyrian couch, all-expectant waits for
  thee. O Hymen Hymenaeus io, O Hymen Hymenaeus!</p>

  <p>Not less than in thine, in his breast burns an inmost flame, but more
  deeply inward. O Hymen Hymenaeus io, O Hymen Hymenaeus!</p>

  <p>Unloose the damsel's slender arm, O purple-bordered youth: now let her
  approach her husband's couch. O Hymen Hymenaeus io, O Hymen
  Hymenaeus.</p>

  <p>Ye good dames of fair renown to aged spouses, put ye the damsel a-bed.
  O Hymen Hymenaeus io, O Hymen Hymenaeus.</p>

  <p>Now thou mayst come, O bridegroom: thy wife is in the bridal-bed, with
  face brightly blushing as white parthenice 'midst ruddy poppies.</p>

  <p>But, O bridegroom (so help me the heaven-dwellers) in no way less
  beautiful art thou, nor doth <!-- Page 124 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page124"></a>[124]</span>Venus slight thee. But the day slips by:
  on! nor more delay.</p>

  <p>Nor long hast thou delayed, thou comest now. May kindly Venus help
  thee, since what thou dost desire thou takest publicly, and dost not
  conceal true love.</p>

  <p>Of Afric's sands and glittering stars the number first let him tell,
  who wishes to keep count of your many-thousand sports.</p>

  <p>Sport as ye like, and speedily give heirs. It does not become so old a
  name to be sans heirs, but for similar stock always to be generated.</p>

  <p>A little Torquatus I wish, from his mother's bosom reaching out his
  dainty hands, and smiling sweetly at his father with lips apart.</p>

  <p>May he be like his sire Manlius, and easily acknowledged by every
  stranger, and by his face point out his mother's faithfulness.</p>

  <p>May such praise confirm his birth from true mother, such fame unique
  as rests with Telemachus from best of mothers, Penelope.</p>

  <p>Close ye the doors, virgins: enough we've sported. But, fair bride and
  groom, live ye well, and diligently fulfil the office of vigorous
  youth.</p>

  <p>Vesper is here, arise ye youths: Vesper at last has just borne aloft
  in the heavens his long-looked-for light. Now 'tis time to arise, now to
  leave the fattened tables, now comes the virgin, now is said the
  Hymenaeus. Hymen O Hymenaeus, Hymen hither O Hymenaeus!</p>

<p class="cenhead"><i>Maidens</i>.</p>

  <p>Discern ye, O unwedded girls, the youths? Arise in response: forsooth
  the Star of Eve displays its Oetaean fires. Thus 'tis; see how fleetly
  have they leapt forth? Nor without intent have they leapt forth, they
  will sing what 'tis meet we surpass. Hymen O Hymenaeus, Hymen hither O
  Hymenaeus!</p>

<p class="cenhead"><i>Youths</i>.</p>

  <p>Nor easily is for us, O comrades, the palm prepared; see ye how they
  talk together in deep thought. Nor in vain do they muse, they have what
  may be worthy of memory. Nor be wonder: for inwardly toil they with whole
  of their minds. Our <!-- Page 133 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page133"></a>[133]</span>minds one way, our ears another, we have
  divided: wherefore by right are we conquered, for victory loveth
  solicitude. So now your minds at the least turn ye hither, now their
  chant they begin, anon ye will have to respond. Hymen O Hymenaeus, Hymen
  hither O Hymenaeus!</p>

<p class="cenhead"><i>Maidens</i>.</p>

  <p>Hesperus! what crueler light is borne aloft in the heavens? Thou who
  canst pluck the maid from her mother's enfolding, pluck from her mother's
  enfolding the firm-clinging maid, and canst give the chaste girl to the
  burning youngster. What more cruel could victors in vanquished city
  contrive? Hymen O Hymenaeus, Hymen hither O Hymenaeus!</p>

<p class="cenhead"><i>Youths</i>.</p>

  <p>Hesperus! what more jocund light is borne aloft in the heavens? Thou
  who dost confirm with thy flame the marriage betrothals which the men had
  pledged, the parents had pledged of aforetime, nor may they be joined in
  completion before thy flame is borne aloft. What can the gods give more
  gladsome than that happy hour? Hymen O Hymenaeus, Hymen hither O
  Hymenaeus!</p>

<p class="cenhead"><i>Maidens</i>.</p>

  <p>* * * * Hesperus from us, O comrades, has stolen one away * * * *
  <i>Hymen O Hymenaeus, Hymen hither O Hymenaeus!</i></p>

  <p>* * * * For at thy advent a guard <!-- Page 134 --><span

  Thieves lie in wait by night, whom often on thy return, O Hesperus, thou
  hap'st upon, when with thy changed name Eous. Yet it doth please the
  unwedded girls to carp at thee with plaints fictitious. But what if they
  carp at that which in close-shut mind they long for? Hymen O Hymenaeus,
  Hymen hither O Hymenaeus!</p>

<p class="cenhead"><i>Maidens</i>.</p>

  <p>As grows the hidden flower in garden closed, to kine unknown, uprooted
  by no ploughshare, whilst the winds caress it, the sun makes it sturdy,
  and the shower gives it growth * * * * many a boy and many a girl longs
  for it: this same when pluckt, deflowered from slender stalklet, never a
  boy and never a girl doth long for it: so the virgin, while she stays
  untouched, so long is she dear to her folk; when she hath lost her chaste
  flower from her body profaned, nor to the boys stays she beauteous, nor
  is she dear to the girls. Hymen O Hymenaeus, Hymen hither O
  Hymenaeus!</p>

<p class="cenhead"><i>Youths</i>.</p>

  <p>As the widowed vine which grows in naked field ne'er uplifts itself,
  ne'er ripens a mellow grape, but bending prone 'neath the weight of its
  tender body now and again its highmost bough touches with its root; this
  no husbandmen, no herdsmen will foster: but if this same chance to be
  joined with marital elm, it many husbandmen, many herdsmen will foster:
  so the virgin, whilst she stays untouched, so long does she age,
  unfostered; but when fitting <!-- Page 135 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  she to her lord and less of a trouble to parent. <i>Hymen O Hymenaeus,
  Hymen hither O Hymenaeus!</i></p>

<p class="cenhead"> <i>Youths and Maidens</i>.</p>

  <p>But struggle not 'gainst such a mate, O virgin. 'Tis improper to
  struggle, thou whose father hath handed thee o'er, that father together
  with thy mother to whom obedience is needed. Thy maidenhead is not wholly
  thine, in part 'tis thy parents': a third part is thy father's, a third
  part is given to thy mother, a third alone is thine: be unwilling to
  struggle against two, who to their son-in-law their rights together with
  dowry have given. Hymen O Hymenaeus, Hymen hither O Hymenaeus!</p>

  <div class="contents">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>O'er high deep seas in speedy ship his voyage Atys sped</p>
      <p>Until he trod the Phrygian grove with hurried eager tread</p>
<!-- Page 139 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page139"></a>[139]</span>
      <p>And as the gloomy tree-shorn stead, the she-god's home, he sought</p>
      <p>There sorely stung with fiery ire and madman's vaguing thought,</p>
      <div class="linenum">5</div><p>Share he with sharpened flint the freight wherewith his form was fraught.</p>
      <p>Then as the she-he sensèd limbs were void of manly strain</p>
      <p>And sighted freshly shed a-ground spot of ensanguined stain,</p>
      <p>Snatched she the timbrel's legier load with hands as snowdrops white,</p>
      <p>Thy timbrel, Mother Cybebé, the firstings of thy rite,</p>
      <div class="linenum">10</div><p>And as her tender finger-tips on bull-back hollow rang</p>
      <p>She rose a-grieving and her song to listening comrades sang.</p>
      <p>"Up Gallæ, hie together, haste for Cybebe's deep grove,</p>
      <p>Hie to the Dindyménean dame, ye flocks that love to rove;</p>
      <p>The which affecting stranger steads as bound in exile's brunt</p>
      <div class="linenum">15</div><p>My sect pursuing led by me have nerved you to confront</p>
      <p>The raging surge of salty sea and ocean's tyrant hand</p>
      <p>As your hate of Venus' hest your manly forms unmann'd,</p>
      <p>Gladden your souls, ye mistresses, with sense of error bann'd.</p>
<!-- Page 140 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page140"></a>[140]</span>
      <p>Drive from your spirits dull delay, together follow ye</p>
      <div class="linenum">20</div><p>To hold of Phrygian goddess, home of Phrygian Cybebe,</p>
      <p>Where loud the cymbal's voice resounds with timbrel-echoes blending,</p>
      <p>And where the Phrygian piper drones grave bass from reed a-bending,</p>
      <p>Where toss their ivy-circled heads with might the Mænades</p>
      <p>Where ply mid shrilly lullilooes the holiest mysteries,</p>
      <div class="linenum">25</div><p>Where to fly here and there be wont the she-god's vaguing train,</p>
      <p>Thither behoves us lead the dance in quick-step hasty strain."</p>
      <p>Soon as had Atys (bastard-she) this lay to comrades sung</p>
      <p>The Chorus sudden lulliloos with quivering, quavering tongue,</p>
      <p>Again the nimble timbrel groans, the scooped-out cymbals clash,</p>
      <div class="linenum">30</div><p>And up green Ida flits the Choir, with footsteps hurrying rash.</p>
      <p>Then Atys frantic, panting, raves, a-wandering, lost, insane,</p>
      <p>And leads with timbrel hent and treads the shades where shadows rain,</p>
      <p>Like heifer spurning load of yoke in yet unbroken pride;</p>
      <p>And the swift Gallæ follow fain their first and fleetfoot guide.</p>
<!-- Page 141 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page141"></a>[141]</span>
      <div class="linenum">35</div><p>But when the home of Cybebe they make with toil out-worn</p>
      <p>O'er much, they lay them down to sleep and gifts of Ceres scorn;</p>
      <p>Till heavy slumbers seal their eyelids langourous, drooping lowly,</p>
      <p>And raving phrenzy flies each brain departing softly, slowly.</p>
      <p>But when Dan Sol with radiant eyes that fire his face of gold</p>
      <div class="linenum">40</div><p>Surveyed white aether and solid soil and waters uncontrol'd,</p>
      <p>And chased with steeds sonorous-hooved the shades of lingering night,</p>
      <p>Then sleep from waking Atys fled fleeting with sudden flight,</p>
      <p>By Nymph Pásithae welcomèd to palpitating breast.</p>
      <p>Thus when his phrenzy raging rash was soothed to gentlest rest,</p>
      <div class="linenum">45</div><p>Atys revolved deeds lately done, as thought from breast unfolding,</p>
      <p>And what he'd lost and what he was with lucid sprite beholding,</p>
      <p>To shallows led by surging soul again the way 'gan take.</p>
      <p>There casting glance of weeping eyes where vasty billows brake,</p>
      <p>Sad-voiced in pitifullest lay his native land bespake.</p>
      <div class="linenum">50</div><p>"Country of me, Creatress mine, O born to thee and bred,</p>

      <p>When me to Ida's groves and glades these vaguing footsteps bore</p>
      <p>To tarry 'mid the snows and where lurk beasts in antres frore</p>
      <p>And seek the deeply hidden lairs where furious ferals meet!</p>
      <div class="linenum">55</div><p>Where, Country! whither placed must I now hold thy site and seat?</p>
      <p>Lief would these balls of eyes direct to thee their line of sight,</p>
      <p>Which for a while, a little while, would free me from despite.</p>
      <p>Must I for ever roam these groves from house and home afar?</p>
      <p>Of country, parents, kith and kin (life's boon) myself debar?</p>
      <div class="linenum">60</div><p>Fly Forum, fly Palestra, fly the Stadium, the Gymnase?</p>
      <p>Wretch, ah poor wretch, I'm doomed (my soul!) to mourn throughout my days,</p>

      <p>I full-grown man, I blooming youth, I stripling, I a boy,</p>
      <p>I of Gymnasium erst the bloom, I too of oil the pride:</p>
      <div class="linenum">65</div><p>Warm was my threshold, ever stood my gateways opening wide,</p>
      <p>My house was ever garlanded and hung with flowery freight,</p>

      <p>And couch to quit with rising sun, has ever been my fate:</p>
      <p>Now must I Cybebe's she-slave, priestess of gods, be hight?</p>
      <p>I Mænad I, mere bit of self, I neutral barren wight?</p>
      <div class="linenum">70</div><p>I spend my life-tide couch't beneath high-towering Phrygian peaks?</p>
      <p>I dwell on Ida's verdant slopes mottled with snowy streaks,</p>
      <p>Where homes the forest-haunting doe, where roams the wildling boar?</p>
      <p>Now, now I rue my deed foredone, now, now it irks me sore!"</p>
      <p>Whenas from out those roseate lips these accents rapid flew,</p>
      <div class="linenum">75</div><p>Bore them to ears divine consigned a Nuncio true and new;</p>
      <p>Then Cybebe her lions twain disjoining from their yoke</p>
      <p>The left-hand enemy of the herds a-goading thus bespoke:&mdash;</p>
      <p>"Up feral fell! up, hie with him, see rage his footsteps urge,</p>
      <p>See that his fury smite him till he seek the forest verge,</p>
      <div class="linenum">80</div><p>He who with over-freedom fain would fly mine empery.</p>
      <p>Go, slash thy flank with lashing tail and sense the strokes of thee,</p>
      <p>Make the whole mountain to thy roar sound and resound again,</p>
<!-- Page 144 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page144"></a>[144]</span>
      <p>And fiercely toss thy brawny neck that bears the tawny mane!"</p>
      <p>So quoth an-angered Cybebe, and yoke with hand untied:</p>
      <div class="linenum">85</div><p>The feral rose in fiery wrath and self-inciting hied,</p>
      <p>A-charging, roaring through the brake with breaking paws he tore.</p>
      <p>But when he reached the humid sands where surges cream the shore,</p>
      <p>Spying soft Atys lingering near the marbled pave of sea</p>
      <p>He springs: the terror-madded wretch back to the wood doth flee,</p>
      <div class="linenum">90</div><p>Where for the remnant of her days a bondmaid's life led she.</p>
      <p>Great Goddess, Goddess Cybebe, Dindymus dame divine,</p>
      <p>Far from my house and home thy wrath and wrack, dread mistress mine:</p>
      <p>Goad others on with Fury's goad, others to Ire consign!</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Over the vast main borne by swift-sailing ship, Attis, as with hasty
  hurried foot he reached the Phrygian wood and gained the tree-girt gloomy
  sanctuary of the Goddess, there roused by rabid rage and mind astray,
  with sharp-edged flint downwards wards dashed his burden of virility.
  Then as he felt his limbs were left without their manhood, and <!-- Page
  145 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page145"></a>[145]</span>the
  fresh-spilt blood staining the soil, with bloodless hand she hastily hent
  a tambour light to hold, taborine thine, O Cybebe, thine initiate rite,
  and with feeble fingers beating the hollowed bullock's back, she rose up
  quivering thus to chant to her companions.</p>

  <p>"Haste ye together, she-priests, to Cybebe's dense woods, together
  haste, ye vagrant herd of the dame Dindymene, ye who inclining towards
  strange places as exiles, following in my footsteps, led by me, comrades,
  ye who have faced the ravening sea and truculent main, and have castrated
  your bodies in your utmost hate of Venus, make glad our mistress speedily
  with your minds' mad wanderings. Let dull delay depart from your
  thoughts, together haste ye, follow to the Phrygian home of Cybebe, to
  the Phrygian woods of the Goddess, where sounds the cymbal's voice, where
  the tambour resounds, where the Phrygian flautist pipes deep notes on the
  curved reed, where the ivy-clad Maenades furiously toss their heads,
  where they enact their sacred orgies with shrill-sounding ululations,
  where that wandering band of the Goddess is wont to flit about: thither
  'tis meet to hasten with hurried mystic dance."</p>

  <p>When Attis, spurious woman, had thus chanted to her comity, the chorus
  straightway shrills with trembling tongues, the light tambour booms, the
  concave cymbals clang, and the troop swiftly hastes with rapid feet to
  verdurous Ida. Then raging wildly, breathless, wandering, with brain
  distraught, <!-- Page 146 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page146"></a>[146]</span>hurrieth Attis with her tambour, their
  leader through dense woods, like an untamed heifer shunning the burden of
  the yoke: and the swift Gallae press behind their speedy-footed leader.
  So when the home of Cybebe they reach, wearied out with excess of toil
  and lack of food they fall in slumber. Sluggish sleep shrouds their eyes
  drooping with faintness, and raging fury leaves their minds to quiet
  ease.</p>

  <p>But when the sun with radiant eyes from face of gold glanced o'er the
  white heavens, the firm soil, and the savage sea, and drave away the
  glooms of night with his brisk and clamorous team, then sleep fast-flying
  quickly sped away from wakening Attis, and goddess Pasithea received
  Somnus in her panting bosom. Then when from quiet rest torn, her delirium
  over, Attis at once recalled to mind her deed, and with lucid thought saw
  what she had lost, and where she stood, with heaving heart she backwards
  traced her steps to the landing-place. There, gazing o'er the vast main
  with tear-filled eyes, with saddened voice in tristful soliloquy thus did
  she lament her land:</p>

  <p>"Mother-land, O my creatress, mother-land, O my begetter, which full
  sadly I'm forsaking, as runaway serfs are wont from their lords, to the
  woods of Ida I have hasted on foot, to stay 'mongst snow and icy dens of
  ferals, and to wander through the hidden lurking-places of ferocious
  beasts. Where, or in what part, O mother-land, may I imagine that thou
  art? My very eyeball craves to fix its glance towards <!-- Page 147
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page147"></a>[147]</span>thee, whilst
  for a brief space my mind is freed from wild ravings. And must I wander
  o'er these woods far from mine home? From country, goods, friends, and
  parents, must I be parted? Leave the forum, the palaestra, the
  race-course, and gymnasium? Wretched, wretched soul, 'tis thine to grieve
  for ever and for aye. For whatso shape is there, whose kind I have not
  worn? I (now a woman), I a man, a stripling, and a lad; I was the
  gymnasium's flower, I was the pride of the oiled wrestlers: my gates, my
  friendly threshold, were crowded, my home was decked with floral
  coronals, when I was wont to leave my couch at sunrise. Now shall I live
  a ministrant of gods and slave to Cybebe? I a Maenad, I a part of me, I a
  sterile trunk! Must I range o'er the snow-clad spots of verdurous Ida,
  and wear out my life 'neath lofty Phrygian peaks, where stay the
  sylvan-seeking stag and woodland-wandering boar? Now, now, I grieve the
  deed I've done; now, now, do I repent!"</p>

  <p>As the swift sound left those rosy lips, borne by new messenger to
  gods' twinned ears, Cybebe, unloosing her lions from their joined yoke,
  and goading the left-hand foe of the herd, thus doth speak: "Come," she
  says, "to work, thou fierce one, cause a madness urge him on, let a fury
  prick him onwards till he return through our woods, he who over-rashly
  seeks to fly from my empire. On! thrash thy flanks with thy tail, endure
  thy strokes; make the whole place re-echo with roar of thy <!-- Page 148
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page148"></a>[148]</span>bellowings;
  wildly toss thy tawny mane about thy nervous neck." Thus ireful Cybebe
  spoke and loosed the yoke with her hand. The monster, self-exciting, to
  rapid wrath his heart doth spur, he rushes, he roars, he bursts through
  the brake with heedless tread. But when he gained the humid verge of the
  foam-flecked shore, and spied the womanish Attis near the opal sea, he
  made a bound: the witless wretch fled into the wild wold: there
  throughout the space of her whole life a bondsmaid did she stay. Great
  Goddess, Goddess Cybebe, Goddess Dame of Dindymus, far from my home may
  all thine anger be, O mistress: urge others to such actions, to madness
  others hound.</p>

  <p>Pines aforetimes sprung from Pelion peak floated, so 'tis said,
  through liquid billows of Neptune to the flowing Phasis and the confines
  Aeetaean, when the picked youth, the vigour of Argive manhood seeking to
  carry away the Golden Fleece from Colchis, dared to skim o'er salt seas
  in a swift-sailing ship, sweeping caerulean ocean with paddles shapen
  from fir-wood. That Goddess who guards the castles in topmost parts of
  the towns herself fashioned the car, scudding with lightest of winds,
  uniting the interweaved pines unto the curving keel. That same first
  instructed untaught Amphitrite with sailing. Scarce had it split with its
  stem the windy waves, and the billow vext with oars had whitened into
  foam, when arose from the abyss of the hoary eddies the faces of
  sea-dwelling Nereids wondering at the marvel. And then on that propitious
  day mortal eyes gazed on sea-nymphs with naked bodies bare to the breasts
  outstanding from the foamy abyss. Then 'tis said Peleus burned with
  desire for Thetis, then Thetis contemned not mortal hymenaeals, then
  Thetis' sire himself sanctioned her joining to Peleus. O born in the time
  of joyfuller ages, heroes, hail! sprung from the gods, good progeny of
  mothers, hail! and favourably be ye inclined. You oft in my song I'll
  address, thee too I'll approach, Peleus, pillar of Thessaly, so increased
  in importance by thy fortunate wedding-torches, to whom Jupiter himself,
  the sire of the gods himself, yielded up his beloved. Did not Thetis
  embrace thee, she most <!-- Page 190 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page190"></a>[190]</span>winsome of Nereids born? Did not Tethys
  consent that thou should'st lead home her grandchild, and Oceanus eke,
  whose waters girdle the total globe? When in full course of time the
  longed-for day had dawned, all Thessaly assembled throngs his home, a
  gladsome company o'erspreading the halls: they bear gifts to the fore,
  and their joy in their faces they shew. Scyros desert remains, they leave
  Phthiotic Tempe, Crannon's homes, and the fortressed walls of Larissa; to
  Pharsalia they hie, 'neath Pharsalian roofs they gather. None tills the
  soil, the heifers' necks grow softened, the trailing vine is not cleansed
  by the curved rake-prongs, nor does the sickle prune the shade of the
  spreading tree-branches, nor does the bullock up-tear the glebe with the
  prone-bending ploughshare; squalid rust steals o'er the neglected
  ploughs.</p>

  <p>But this mansion, throughout its innermost recesses of opulent
  royalty, glitters with gleaming gold and with silver. Ivory makes white
  the seats; goblets glint on the boards; the whole house delights in the
  splendour of royal treasure. Placed in the midst of the mansion is the
  bridal bed of the goddess, made glossy with Indian tusks and covered with
  purple, tinted with the shell-fish's rosy dye. This tapestry embroidered
  with figures of men of ancient time pourtrays with admirable art the
  heroes' valour. For looking forth from Dia's beach, resounding with
  crashing of breakers, Theseus hasting from sight with swiftest of fleets,
  Ariadne watches, her heart <!-- Page 191 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page191"></a>[191]</span>swelling with raging passion, nor scarce
  yet credits she sees what she sees, as, newly-awakened from her deceptive
  sleep, she perceives herself, deserted and woeful, on the lonely shore.
  But the heedless youth, flying away, beats the waves with his oars,
  leaving his perjured vows to the gusty gales. In the dim distance from
  amidst the sea-weed, the daughter of Minos with sorrowful eyes, like a
  stone-carved Bacchante, gazes afar, alas! gazes after him, heaving with
  great waves of grief. No longer does the fragile fillet bind her yellow
  locks, no more with light veil is her hidden bosom covered, no more with
  rounded zone the milky breasts are clasped; down fallen from her body
  everything is scattered, hither, thither, and the salt waves toy with
  them in front of her very feet. But neither on fillet nor floating veil,
  but on thee, Theseus, in their stead, was she musing: on thee she bent
  her heart, her thoughts, her love-lorn mind. Ah, woeful one, with sorrows
  unending distraught, Erycina sows thorny cares deep in thy bosom, since
  that time when Theseus fierce in his vigour set out from the curved bay
  of Piraeus, and gained the Gortynian roofs of the iniquitous ruler.</p>

  <p>For of old 'tis narrated, that constrained by plague of the cruelest
  to expiate the slaughter of Androgeos, both chosen youths and the pick of
  the unmarried maidens Cecropia was wont to give as a feast to the
  Minotaur. When thus his strait walls with ills were vexed, Theseus with
  free will preferred to yield up his body for adored Athens rather than
  <!-- Page 192 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page192"></a>[192]</span>such Cecropian corpses be carried to Crete
  unobsequied. And therefore borne in a speedy craft by favouring breezes,
  he came to the imperious Minos and his superb seat. Instant the royal
  virgin him saw with longing glance, she whom the chaste couch
  out-breathing sweetest of scents cradled in her mother's tender
  enfoldings, like to the myrtle which the rivers of Eurotas produce, or
  the many-tinted blooms opening with the springtide's breezes, she bent
  not down away from him her kindling glance, until the flame spread
  through her whole body, and burned into her innermost marrow. Ah, hard of
  heart, urging with misery to madness, O holy boy, who mingles men's cares
  and their joyings, and thou queen of Golgos and of foliaged Idalium, on
  what waves did you heave the mind-kindled maid, sighing full oft for the
  golden-haired guest! What dreads she bore in her swooning soul! How often
  did she grow sallower in sheen than gold! When craving to contend against
  the savage monster Theseus faced death or the palm of praise. Then gifts
  to the gods not unmeet not idly given, with promise from tight-closed
  lips did she address her vows. For as an oak waving its boughs on Taurus'
  top, or a coniferous pine with sweating stem, is uprooted by savage
  storm, twisting its trunk with its blast (dragged from its roots prone it
  falleth afar, breaking all in the line of its fall) so did Theseus fling
  down the conquered body of the brute, tossing its horns in vain towards
  the skies. Thence <!-- Page 193 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page193"></a>[193]</span>backwards he retraced his steps 'midst
  great laud, guiding his errant footsteps by means of a tenuous thread,
  lest when outcoming from tortuous labyrinthines his efforts be frustrated
  by unobservant wandering. But why, turned aside from my first story,
  should I recount more, how the daughter fleeing her father's face, her
  sister's embrace, and e'en her mother's, who despairingly bemoaned her
  lost daughter, preferred to all these the sweet love of Theseus; or how
  borne by their boat to the spumy shores of Dia she came; or how her
  yokeman with unmemoried breast forsaking her, left her bound in the
  shadows of sleep? And oft, so 'tis said, with her heart burning with fury
  she outpoured clarion cries from depths of her bosom, then sadly scaled
  the rugged mounts, whence she could cast her glance o'er the vasty
  seething ocean, then ran into the opposing billows of the heaving sea,
  raising from her bared legs her clinging raiment, and in uttermost plight
  of woe with tear-stained face and chilly sobs spake she thus:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Is it thus, O perfidious, when dragged from my motherland's shores,
  is it thus, O false Theseus, that thou leavest me on this desolate
  strand? thus dost depart unmindful of slighted godheads, bearing home thy
  perjured vows? Was no thought able to bend the intent of thy ruthless
  mind? hadst thou no clemency there, that thy pitiless bowels might
  compassionate me? But these were not the promises thou gavest me idly of
  old, this was not what thou didst bid me hope for, but the blithe
  bride-bed, <!-- Page 194 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page194"></a>[194]</span>hymenaeal happiness: all empty air, blown
  away by the breezes. Now, now, let no woman give credence to man's oath,
  let none hope for faithful vows from mankind; for whilst their eager
  desire strives for its end, nothing fear they to swear, nothing of
  promises stint they: but instant their lusting thoughts are satiate with
  lewdness, nothing of speech they remember, nothing of perjuries reck. In
  truth I snatched thee from the midst of the whirlpool of death,
  preferring to suffer the loss of a brother rather than fail thy need in
  the supreme hour, O ingrate. For the which I shall be a gift as prey to
  be rent by wild beasts and the carrion-fowl, nor dead shall I be placed
  in the earth, covered with funeral mound. What lioness bare thee 'neath
  lonely crag? What sea conceived and spued thee from its foamy crest? What
  Syrtis, what grasping Scylla, what vast Charybdis? O thou repayer with
  such guerdon for thy sweet life! If 'twas not thy heart's wish to yoke
  with me, through holding in horror the dread decrees of my stern sire,
  yet thou couldst have led me to thy home, where as thine handmaid I might
  have served thee with cheerful service, laving thy snowy feet with clear
  water, or spreading the purple coverlet o'er thy couch. Yet why,
  distraught with woe, do I vainly lament to the unknowing winds, which
  unfurnished with sense, can neither hear uttered complaints nor can
  return them? For now he has sped away into the midst of the seas, nor
  doth any mortal appear along this desolate seaboard. Thus with
  o'erweening <!-- Page 195 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page195"></a>[195]</span>scorn doth bitter Fate in my extreme hour
  even grudge ears to my plaints. All-powerful Jupiter! would that in old
  time the Cecropian poops had not touched at the Gnossian shores, nor that
  bearing to the unquelled bull the direful ransom had the false mariner
  moored his hawser to Crete, nor that yon wretch hiding ruthless designs
  beneath sweet seemings had reposed as a guest in our halls! For whither
  may I flee? in what hope, O lost one, take refuge? Shall I climb the
  Idomenean crags? but the truculent sea stretching amain with its
  whirlings of waters separates us. Can I quest help from my father, whom I
  deserted to follow a youth besprinkled with my brother's blood? Can I
  crave comfort from the care of a faithful yokeman, who is fleeing with
  yielding oars, encurving 'midst whirling waters. If I turn from the beach
  there is no roof in this tenantless island, no way sheweth a passage,
  circled by waves of the sea; no way of flight, no hope; all denotes
  dumbness, desolation, and death. Natheless mine eyes shall not be dimmed
  in death, nor my senses secede from my spent frame, until I have besought
  from the gods a meet mulct for my betrayal, and implored the faith of the
  celestials with my latest breath. Wherefore ye requiters of men's deeds
  with avenging pains, O Eumenides, whose front enwreathed with
  serpent-locks blazons the wrath exhaled from your bosom, hither, hither
  haste, hear ye my plainings, which I, sad wretch, am urged to outpour
  from mine innermost marrow, helpless, burning, and blind <!-- Page 196
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page196"></a>[196]</span>with frenzied
  fury. And since in truth they spring from the veriest depths of my heart,
  be ye unwilling to allow my agony to pass unheeded, but with such mind as
  Theseus forsook me, with like mind, O goddesses, may he bring evil on
  himself and on his kin."</p>

  <p>After she had poured forth these words from her grief-laden bosom,
  distractedly clamouring for requital against his heartless deeds, the
  celestial ruler assented with almighty nod, at whose motion the earth and
  the awe-full waters quaked, and the world of glittering stars did quiver.
  But Theseus, self-blinded with mental mist, let slip from forgetful
  breast all those injunctions which until then he had held firmly in mind,
  nor bore aloft sweet signals to his sad sire, shewing himself safe when
  in sight of Erectheus' haven. For 'tis said that aforetime, when Aegeus
  entrusted his son to the winds, on leaving the walls of the chaste
  goddess's city, these commands he gave to the youth with his parting
  embrace.</p>

  <p>"O mine only son, far dearer to me than long life, lately restored to
  me at extreme end of my years, O son whom I must perforce dismiss to a
  doubtful hazard, since my ill fate and thine ardent valour snatch thee
  from unwilling me, whose dim eyes are not yet sated with my son's dear
  form: nor gladly and with joyous breast do I send thee, nor will I suffer
  thee to bear signs of helpful fortune, but first from my breast many a
  plaint will I express, sullying my grey hairs with dust and ashes, and
  then will I hang dusky sails to the swaying mast, so that <!-- Page 197
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page197"></a>[197]</span>our sorrow and
  burning lowe are shewn by Iberian canvas, rustily darkened. Yet if the
  dweller on holy Itone, who deigns defend our race and Erectheus'
  dwellings, grant thee to besprinkle thy right hand in the bull's blood,
  then see that in very truth these commandments deep-stored in thine
  heart's memory do flourish, nor any time deface them. Instant thine eyes
  shall see our cliffs, lower their gloomy clothing from every yard, and
  let the twisted cordage bear aloft snowy sails, where splendent shall
  shine bright topmast spars, so that, instant discerned, I may know with
  gladness and lightness of heart that in prosperous hour thou art returned
  to my face."</p>

  <p>These charges, at first held in constant mind, from Theseus slipped
  away as clouds are impelled by the breath of the winds from the ethereal
  peak of a snow-clad mount. But his father as he betook himself to the
  castle's turrets as watchplace, dimming his anxious eyes with continual
  weeping, when first he spied the discoloured canvas, flung himself
  headlong from the top of the crags, deeming Theseus lost by harsh fate.
  Thus as he entered the grief-stricken house, his paternal roof, Theseus
  savage with slaughter met with like grief as that which with unmemoried
  mind he had dealt to Minos' daughter: while she with grieving gaze at his
  disappearing keel, turned over a tumult of cares in her wounded
  spirit.</p>

  <p>But on another part [of the tapestry] swift hastened the flushed
  Iacchus with his train of Satyrs and Nisa-begot Sileni, thee questing,
  Ariadne, <!-- Page 198 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page198"></a>[198]</span>and aflame with love for thee. * * * *
  These scattered all around, an inspired band, rushed madly with mind all
  distraught, ranting "Euhoe," with tossing of heads "Euhoe." Some with
  womanish hands shook thyrsi with wreath-covered points; some tossed limbs
  of a rended steer; some engirt themselves with writhed snakes; some
  enacted obscure orgies with deep chests, orgies of which the profane
  vainly crave a hearing; others beat the tambours with outstretched palms,
  or from the burnished brass provoked shrill tinklings, blew
  raucous-sounding blasts from many horns, and the barbarous pipe droned
  forth horrible song.</p>

  <p>With luxury of such figures was the coverlet adorned, enwrapping the
  bed with its mantling embrace. After the Thessalian youthhood with eager
  engazing were sated they began to give way to the sacred gods. Hence, as
  with his morning's breath brushing the still sea Zephyrus makes the
  sloping billows uprise, when Aurora mounts 'neath the threshold of the
  wandering sun, which waves heave slowly at first with the breeze's gentle
  motion (plashing with the sound as of low laughter) but after, as swells
  the wind, more and more frequent they crowd and gleam in the purple light
  as they float away,&mdash;so quitting the royal vestibule did the folk
  hie them away each to his home with steps wandering hither and
  thither.</p>

  <p>After they had wended their way, chief from the Pelion vertex Chiron
  came, the bearer of sylvan <!-- Page 199 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page199"></a>[199]</span>spoil: for whatsoever the fields bear,
  whatso the Thessalian land on its high hills breeds, and what flowers the
  fecund air of warm Favonius begets near the running streams, these did he
  bear enwreathed into blended garlands wherewith the house rippled with
  laughter, caressed by the grateful odour.</p>

  <p>Speedily stands present Penios, for a time his verdant Tempe, Tempe
  whose overhanging trees encircle, leaving to the Dorian choirs, damsels
  Magnesian, to frequent; nor empty-handed,&mdash;for he has borne hither
  lofty beeches uprooted and the tall laurel with straight stem, nor lacks
  he the nodding plane and the lithe sister of flame-wrapt Phaethon and the
  aerial cypress. These wreathed in line did he place around the palace so
  that the vestibule might grow green sheltered with soft fronds.</p>

  <p>After him follows Prometheus of inventive mind, bearing diminishing
  traces of his punishment of aforetime, which of old he had suffered, with
  his limbs confined by chains hanging from the rugged Scythian crags. Then
  came the sire of gods from heaven with his holy consort and offspring,
  leaving thee alone, Phoebus, with thy twin-sister the fosterer of the
  mountains of Idrus: for equally with thyself did thy sister disdain
  Peleus nor was she willing to honour the wedding torches of Thetis. After
  they had reclined their snow-white forms along the seats, tables were
  loaded on high with food of various kinds. <!-- Page 200 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page200"></a>[200]</span></p>

  <p>In the meantime with shaking bodies and infirm gesture the Parcae
  began to intone their veridical chant. Their trembling frames were
  enwrapped around with white garments, encircled with a purple border at
  their heels, snowy fillets bound each aged brow, and their hands pursued
  their never-ending toil, as of custom. The left hand bore the distaff
  enwrapped in soft wool, the right hand lightly withdrawing the threads
  with upturned fingers did shape them, then twisting them with the prone
  thumb it turned the balanced spindle with well-polished whirl. And then
  with a pluck of their tooth the work was always made even, and the bitten
  wool-shreds adhered to their dried lips, which shreds at first had stood
  out from the fine thread. And in front of their feet wicker baskets of
  osier twigs took charge of the soft white woolly fleece. These, with
  clear-sounding voice, as they combed out the wool, outpoured fates of
  such kind in sacred song, in song which none age yet to come could tax
  with untruth.</p>

  <p>"O with great virtues thine exceeding honour augmenting, stay of
  Emathia-land, most famous in thine issue, receive what the sisters make
  known to thee on this gladsome day, a weird veridical! But ye whom the
  fates do follow:&mdash;Haste ye, a-weaving the woof, O hasten, ye
  spindles.</p>

  <p>"Now Hesperus shall come unto thee bearing what is longed for by
  bridegrooms, with that fortunate star shall thy bride come, who ensteeps
  thy soul with the sway of softening love, and prepares with thee <!--
  Page 201 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page201"></a>[201]</span>to
  conjoin in languorous slumber, making her smooth arms thy pillow round
  'neath thy sinewy neck. Haste ye, a-weaving the woof, O hasten, ye
  spindles.</p>

  <p>"No house ever yet enclosed such loves, no love bound lovers with such
  pact, as abideth with Thetis, as is the concord of Peleus. Haste ye,
  a-weaving the woof, O hasten, ye spindles.</p>

  <p>"To ye shall Achilles be born, a stranger to fear, to his foemen not
  by his back, but by his broad breast known, who, oft-times the victor in
  the uncertain struggle of the foot-race, shall outrun the fire-fleet
  footsteps of the speedy doe. Haste ye, a-weaving the woof, O hasten, ye
  spindles.</p>

  <p>"None in war with him may compare as a hero, when the Phrygian streams
  shall trickle with Trojan blood, and when besieging the walls of Troy

  o'er funeral-rites of their sons, when the white locks from their heads
  are unloosed amid ashes, and they bruise their discoloured breasts with
  feeble fists. Haste ye, a-weaving the woof, O hasten, ye spindles.</p>

  <p>"For as the husbandman bestrewing the dense wheat-ears mows the
  harvest yellowed 'neath ardent sun, so shall he cast prostrate the
  corpses of Troy's sons with grim swords. Haste ye, a-weaving the woof, O

  pours itself into the swift Hellespont, narrowing whose course with
  slaughtered heaps of corpses he shall make tepid its deep stream by
  mingling warm blood with the water. Haste ye, a-weaving the woof, O

  <p>"And she a witness in fine shall be the captive-maid handed to death,
  when the heaped-up tomb of earth built in lofty mound shall receive the
  snowy limbs of the stricken virgin. Haste ye, a-weaving the woof, O
  hasten, ye spindles.</p>

  <p>"For instant fortune shall give the means to the war-worn Greeks to
  break Neptune's stone bonds of the Dardanian city, the tall tomb shall be
  made dank with Polyxena's blood, who as the victim succumbing 'neath
  two-edged sword, with yielding hams shall fall forward a headless corpse.
  Haste ye, a-weaving the woof, O hasten, ye spindles.</p>

  <p>"Wherefore haste ye to conjoin in the longed-for delights of your
  love. Bridegroom thy goddess receive in felicitous compact; let the bride
  be given to her eager husband. Haste ye, a-weaving the woof, O hasten, ye
  spindles.</p>

  <p>"Nor shall the nurse at orient light returning, with yester-e'en's
  thread succeed in circling her neck. [Haste ye, a-weaving the woof, O
  hasten, ye spindles.] Not need her solicitous mother fear sad discord
  shall cause a parted bed for her daughter, nor need she cease to hope for
  dear grandchildren. Haste ye, a-weaving the woof, O hasten, ye spindles."

  <p>With such soothsaying songs of yore did the Parcae chant from divine
  breast the felicitous fate of Peleus. For of aforetime the
  heaven-dwellers were wont to visit the chaste homes of heroes and to shew
  themselves in mortal assembly ere yet their worship was scorned. Often
  the father of the gods, a-resting in his glorious temple, when on the
  festal days his annual rites appeared, gazed on an hundred bulls strewn
  prone on the earth. Often wandering Liber on topmost summit of Parnassus
  led his yelling Thyiads with loosely tossed locks. * * * * When the
  Delphians tumultuously trooping from the whole of their city joyously
  acclaimed the god with smoking altars. Often in lethal strife of war
  Mavors, or swift Triton's queen, or the Rhamnusian virgin, in person did
  exhort armed bodies of men. But after the earth was infected with heinous
  crime, and each one banished justice from their grasping mind, and
  brothers steeped their hands in fraternal blood, the son ceased grieving
  o'er departed parents, the sire craved for the funeral rites of his
  first-born that freely he might take of the flower of unwedded step-dame,
  the unholy mother, lying under her unknowing son, did not fear to sully
  her household gods with dishonour: everything licit and lawless
  commingled with mad infamy turned away from us the just-seeing mind of
  the gods. Wherefore nor do they deign to appear at such-like assemblies,
  nor will they permit themselves to be met in the day-light. <!-- Page 204

  </div>
  <p>He who scanned all the lights of the great firmament, who ascertained
  the rising and the setting of the stars, how the flaming splendour of the
  swift sun was endarkened, how the planets disappear at certain seasons,
  how sweet love with <!-- Page 216 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page216"></a>[216]</span>stealth detaining Trivia beneath the
  Latmian crags, draws her away from her airy circuit, that same Conon saw
  me amongst celestial light, the hair from Berenice's head, gleaming with
  brightness, which she outstretching graceful arms did devote to the whole
  of the gods, when the king flushed with the season of new wedlock had
  gone to lay waste the Assyrian borders, bearing the sweet traces of
  nightly contests, in which he had borne away her virginal spoils. Is
  Venus abhorred by new-made brides? Why be the parents' joys turned aside
  by feigned tears, which they shed copiously amid the lights of the
  nuptial chamber? Untrue are their groans, by the gods I swear! This did
  my queen teach me by her many lamentings, when her bridegroom set out for
  stern warfare. Yet thou didst not mourn the widowhood of desolate couch,
  but the tearful separation from a dear brother? How care made sad inroads
  in thy very marrow! In so much that thine whole bosom being agitated, and
  thy senses being snatched from thee, thy mind wandered! But in truth I
  have known thee great of heart ever since thou wast a little maiden. Hast
  thou forgotten that noble deed, by which thou didst gain a regal wedlock,
  than which none dared other deeds bolder? Yet what grieving words didst
  thou speak when bidding thy bridegroom farewell! Jupiter! as with sad
  hand often thine eyes thou didst dry! What mighty god changed thee? Was
  it that lovers are unwilling to be long absent from <!-- Page 217
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page217"></a>[217]</span>their dear
  one's body? Then didst thou devote me to the whole of the gods on thy
  sweet consort's behalf, not without blood of bullocks, should he be
  granted safe return. In no long time he added captive Asia to the
  Egyptian boundaries. Wherefore for these reasons I, bestowed 'midst the
  celestial host, by a new gift fulfil thine ancient promise. With grief, O
  queen, did I quit thy brow, with grief: I swear to thee and to thine
  head; fit ill befall whosoever shall swear lightly: but who may bear
  himself peer with steel? Even that mountain was swept away, the greatest
  on earth, over which Thia's illustrious progeny passed, when the Medes
  created a new sea, and the barbarian youth sailed its fleet through the
  middle of Athos. What can locks of hair do, when such things yield to
  iron? Jupiter! may the whole race of the Chalybes perish, and whoever
  first questing the veins 'neath the earth harassed its hardness, breaking
  it through with iron. Just before severance my sister locks were mourning
  my fate, when Ethiop Memnon's brother, the winged steed, beating the air
  with fluttering pennons, appeared before Locrian Arsinoe, and this one
  bearing me up, flies through aethereal shadows and lays me in the chaste
  bosom of Venus. Him Zephyritis herself had dispatched as her servant, a
  Grecian settler on the Canopian shores. For 'twas the wish of many gods
  that not alone in heaven's light should the golden coronet from Ariadne's
  temples stay fixed, but that we also should gleam, <!-- Page 218 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page218"></a>[218]</span>the spoils devote from
  thy golden-yellow head; when humid with weeping I entered the temples of
  the gods, the Goddess placed me, a new star, amongst the ancient ones.
  For a-touching the Virgin's and the fierce Lion's gleams, hard by
  Callisto of Lycaon, I turn westwards fore-guiding the slow-moving Bootes
  who sinks unwillingly and late into the vasty ocean. But although the
  footsteps of the gods o'erpress me in the night-tide, and the daytime
  restoreth me to the white-haired Tethys, (grant me thy grace to speak
  thus, O Rhamnusian virgin, for I will not hide the truth through any
  fear, even if the stars revile me with ill words yet I will unfold the
  pent-up feelings from truthful breast) I am not so much rejoiced at these
  things as I am tortured by being for ever parted, parted from my lady's
  head, with whom I (though whilst a virgin she was free from all such
  cares) drank many a thousand of Syrian scents.</p>

  <p>Now do you, whom the gladsome light of the wedding torches hath
  joined, yield not your bodies to your desiring husbands nor throw aside
  your vestments and bare your bosom's nipples, before your onyx cup brings
  me jocund gifts, your onyx, ye who seek the dues of chaste marriage-bed.
  But she who giveth herself to foul adultery, may the light-lying dust
  responselessly drink her vile gifts, for I seek no offerings from folk
  that do ill. But rather, O brides, may concord always be yours, <!-- Page
  219 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page219"></a>[219]</span>and
  constant love ever dwell in your homes. But when thou, O queen, whilst
  gazing at the stars, shalt propitiate the goddess Venus with festal
  torch-lights, let not me, thine own, be left lacking of unguent, but
  rather gladden me with large gifts. Stars fall in confusion! So that I
  become a royal tress, Orion might gleam in Aquarius' company.</p>

<p class="cenhead"><i>Catullus</i>.</p>

  <p>O dear in thought to the sweet husband, dear in thought to his sire,
  hail! and may Jove augment his good grace to thee, Door! which of old,
  men say, didst serve Balbus benignly, whilst the oldster held his home
  here; and which contrariwise, so 'tis said, didst serve with grudging
  service after the old man was stretched stark, thou doing service to the
  bride. Come, tell us why thou art reported to be changed and to have
  renounced thine ancient faithfulness to thy lord?</p>

<p class="cenhead"><i>Door</i>.</p>

  <p>No, (so may I please Caecilius to whom I am now made over!) it is not
  my fault, although 'tis said so to be, nor may anyone impute any crime to
  me; albeit the fabling tongues of folk make it so, who, whene'er aught is
  found not well done, all clamour at me: "Door, thine is the blame!"</p>

<p class="cenhead"><i>Catullus</i>.</p>

  <p>It is not enough for thee to say this by words merely, but so to act
  that everyone may feel it and see it.</p>

<p class="cenhead"><i>Door</i>.</p>

  <p>In what way can I? No one questions or troubles to know.</p>

<p><!-- Page 225 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page225"></a>[225]</span></p>

<p class="cenhead"><i>Catullus</i>.</p>

  <p>We are wishful: be not doubtful to tell us.</p>

<p class="cenhead"><i>Door</i>.</p>

  <p>First then, the virgin (so they called her!) who was handed to us was
  spurious. Her husband was not the first to touch her, he whose little
  dagger, hanging more limply than the tender beet, never raised itself to
  the middle of his tunic: but his father is said to have violated his
  son's bed and to have polluted the unhappy house, either because his lewd
  mind blazed with blind lust, or because his impotent son was sprung from
  sterile seed, and therefore one greater of nerve than he was needed, who
  could unloose the virgin's zone.</p>

<p class="cenhead"><i>Catullus</i>.</p>

  <p>Thou tellest of an excellent parent marvellous in piety, who himself
  urined in the womb of his son!</p>

<p class="cenhead"><i>Door</i>.</p>

  <p>But not this alone is Brixia said to have knowledge of, placed 'neath
  the Cycnean peak, through which the golden-hued Mella flows with its
  gentle current, Brixia, beloved mother of my Verona. For it talks of the
  loves of Postumius and of Cornelius, with whom she committed foul
  adultery.</p>

<p class="cenhead"><i>Catullus</i>.</p>

  <p>Folk might say here: "How knowest thou these things, O door? thou who
  art never allowed absence from thy lord's threshold, nor mayst hear <!--
  Page 226 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page226"></a>[226]</span>the
  folk's gossip, but fixed to this beam art wont only to open or to shut
  the house!"</p>

<p class="cenhead"><i>Door</i>.</p>

  <p>Often have I heard her talking with hushed voice, when alone with her
  handmaids, about her iniquities, quoting by name those whom we have
  spoken of, for she did not expect me to be gifted with either tongue or
  ear. Moreover she added a certain one whose name I'm unwilling to speak,
  lest he uplift his red eyebrows. A lanky fellow, against whom some time
  ago was brought a grave law-suit anent the spurious child-birth of a
  lying belly.</p>

      <p class="i2">Ever delight thy mind sleepless in anxious care;</p>
      <p>Grateful be this to my thought since thus thy friend I'm entitled,</p>

      <p>Learn how in Fortune's deeps I chance myself to be drownèd,</p>
      <p class="i2">Nor fro' the poor rich boons furthermore prithee require.</p>
      <div class="linenum">15</div><p>What while first to myself the pure-white garment was given,</p>
<!-- Page 233 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page233"></a>[233]</span>
      <p class="i2">Whenas my flowery years flowed in fruition of spring,</p>
      <p>Much I disported enow, nor 'bode I a stranger to Goddess</p>
      <p class="i2">Who with our cares is lief sweetness of bitter to mix:</p>
      <p>Yet did a brother's death pursuits like these to my sorrow</p>
      <div class="linenum">20</div><p class="i2">Bid for me cease: Oh, snatcht brother! from wretchedest me.</p>
      <p>Then, yea, thou by thy dying hast broke my comfort, O brother;</p>

      <p>Perisht along wi' thyself all gauds and joys of our life-tide,</p>
      <p class="i2">Douce love fostered by thee during the term of our days.</p>
      <div class="linenum">25</div><p>After thy doom of death fro' mind I banishèd wholly</p>
      <p class="i2">Studies like these, and all lending a solace to soul;</p>
      <p>Wherefore as to thy writ:&mdash;"Verona's home for Catullus</p>
      <p class="i2">Bringeth him shame, for there men of superior mark</p>
      <p>Must on a deserted couch fain chafe their refrigerate limbs:"</p>
      <div class="linenum">30</div><p class="i2">Such be no shame (Manius!): rather 'tis matter of ruth.</p>

      <p>Pardon me, then, wilt thou an gifts bereft me by grieving</p>
      <p class="i2">These I send not to thee since I avail not presènt.</p>
      <p>For, that I own not here abundant treasure of writings</p>
      <p class="i2">Has for its cause, in Rome dwell I; and there am I homed,</p>
      <div class="linenum">35</div><p>There be my seat, and there my years are gathered to harvest;</p>
      <p class="i2">Out of book-cases galore here am I followed by one.</p>
      <p>This being thus, nill I thou deem 'tis spirit malignant</p>
      <p class="i2">Acts in such wise or mind lacking of liberal mood</p>
      <p>That to thy prayer both gifts be not in plenty supplièd:</p>
      <div class="linenum">40</div><p class="i2">Willingly both had I sent, had I the needed supply.</p>
      <p>Nor can I (Goddesses!) hide in what things Allius sent me</p>

      <div class="linenum">55</div><p>Nor did these saddened eyes to be dimmed by assiduous weeping</p>

  <p>That when, opprest by fortune and in grievous case, thou didst send me
  this epistle o'erwrit with tears, that I might bear up shipwrecked thee
  tossed by the foaming waves of the sea, and restore thee from the
  threshold of death; thou whom neither sacred Venus suffers to repose in
  soft slumber, desolate on a a lonely couch, nor do the Muses divert with
  the sweet song of ancient poets, whilst thy anxious mind keeps
  vigil:&mdash;this is grateful to me, since thou dost call me thy friend,
  and dost seek hither the gifts of the Muses and of Venus. But that my
  troubles may not be unknown to thee, O Manius, nor thou deem I shun the
  office of host, hear how I am whelmed in the waves of that same fortune,
  nor further seek joyful gifts from a wretched one. In that time when the
  white vestment was first handed to me, and my florid age was passing in
  jocund spring, much did I sport enow: nor was the goddess unknown to us
  who mixes bitter-sweet with our cares. But my brother's death plunged all
  this pursuit into mourning. O brother, taken from my unhappy self; thou
  by thy dying hast broken my ease, O brother; all our house is buried with
  thee; with thee have perished the whole of our joys, which thy sweet love
  nourished in thy lifetime. Thou lost, I have dismissed wholly from mind
  these studies and every delight of mind. Wherefore, as to what thou
  writest, "'Tis shameful for Catullus to be at Verona, for there anyone of
  utmost note must chafe his frigid limbs on a desolate couch;" that,
  Manius, is not shameful; rather 'tis a <!-- Page 243 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page243"></a>[243]</span>pity. Therefore, do
  thou forgive, if what grief has snatched from me, these gifts, I do not
  bestow on thee, because I am unable. For, that there is no great store of
  writings with me arises from this, that we live at Rome: there is my
  home, there is my hall, thither my time is passed; hither but one of my
  book-cases follows me. As 'tis thus, I would not that thou deem we act so
  from ill-will or from a mind not sufficiently ingenuous, that ample store
  is not forthcoming to either of thy desires: both would I grant, had I
  the wherewithal. Nor can I conceal, goddesses, in what way Allius has
  aided me, or with how many good offices he has assisted me; nor shall
  fleeting time with its forgetful centuries cover with night's blindness
  this care of his. But I tell it to you, and do ye declare it to many
  thousands, and make this paper, grown old, speak of it * * * * And let
  him be more and more noted when dead, nor let the spider aloft, weaving
  her thin-drawn web, carry on her work over the neglected name of Allius.
  For you know what anxiety of mind wily Amathusia gave me, and in what
  manner she overthrew me, when I was burning like the Trinacrian rocks, or
  the Malian fount in Oetaean Thermopylae; nor did my piteous eyes cease to
  dissolve with continual weeping, nor my cheeks with sad showers to be
  bedewed. As the pellucid stream gushes forth from the moss-grown rock on
  the aerial crest of the mountain, which when it has rolled headlong prone
  down the valley, softly wends its way through the midst of the <!-- Page
  244 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page244"></a>[244]</span>populous
  parts, sweet solace to the wayfarer sweating with weariness, when the
  oppressive heat cracks the burnt-up fields agape: or, as to sailors
  tempest-tossed in black whirlpool, there cometh a favourable and a
  gently-moving breeze, Pollux having been prayed anon, and Castor alike
  implored: of such kind was Manius' help to us. He with a wider limit laid
  open my closed field; he gave us a home and its mistress, on whom we both
  might exercise our loves in common. Thither with gracious gait my
  bright-hued goddess betook herself, and pressed her shining sole on the
  worn threshold with creaking of sandal; as once came Laodamia, flaming
  with love for her consort, to the home of Protesilaus,&mdash;a beginning
  of naught! for not yet with sacred blood had a victim made propitiate the
  lords of the heavens. May nothing please me so greatly, Rhamnusian
  virgin, that I should act thus heedlessly against the will of those
  lords! How the thirsty altar craves for sacrificial blood Laodamia was
  taught by the loss of her husband, being compelled to abandon the neck of
  her new spouse when one winter was past, before another winter had come,
  in whose long nights she might so glut her greedy love, that she could
  have lived despite her broken marriage-yoke, which the Parcae knew would
  not be long distant, if her husband as soldier should fare to the Ilian
  walls. For by Helena's rape Troy had begun to put the Argive Chiefs in
  the field; Troy accurst, the common grave of Asia and <!-- Page 245
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page245"></a>[245]</span>of Europe,
  Troy, the sad ashes of heroes and of every noble deed, that also
  lamentably brought death to our brother. O brother taken from unhappy me!
  O jocund light taken from thy unhappy brother! in thy one grave lies all
  our house, in thy one grave have perished all our joys, which thy sweet
  love did nurture during life. Whom now is laid so far away, not amongst
  familiar tombs nor near the ashes of his kindred, but obscene Troy,
  malign Troy, an alien earth, holds thee entombed in its remote soil.
  Thither, 'tis said, hastening together from all parts, the Grecian
  manhood forsook their hearths and homes, lest Paris enjoy his abducted
  trollop with freedom and leisure in a peaceful bed. Such then was thy
  case, loveliest Laodamia, to be bereft of husband sweeter than life, and
  than soul; thou being sucked in so great a whirlpool of love, its eddy
  submerged thee in its steep abyss, like (so folk say) to the Graian gulph
  near Pheneus of Cyllene with its fat swamp's soil drained and dried,
  which aforetime the falsely-born Amphitryoniades dared to hew through the
  marrow of cleft mountains, at the time when he smote down the Stymphalian
  monsters with sure shafts by the command of his inferior lord, so that
  the heavenly portal might be pressed by a greater number of deities, nor
  Hebe longer remain in her virginity. But deeper than that abyss was thy
  deep love which taught [thy husband] to bear his lady's forceful yoke.
  For not so dear to the spent age of the grandsire is the late born <!--
  Page 246 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page246"></a>[246]</span>grandchild an only daughter rears, who,
  long-wished-for, at length inherits the ancestral wealth, his name duly
  set down in the attested tablets; and casting afar the impious hopes of
  the baffled next-of-kin, scares away the vulture from the whitened head;
  nor so much does any dove-mate rejoice in her snow-white consort (though,
  'tis averred, more shameless than most in continually plucking kisses
  with nibbling beak) as thou dost, though woman is especially inconstant.
  But thou alone didst surpass the great frenzies of these, when thou wast
  once united to thy yellow-haired husband. Worthy to yield to whom in
  naught or in little, my light brought herself to my bosom, round whom
  Cupid, often running hither thither, gleamed lustrous-white in
  saffron-tinted tunic. Still although she is not content with Catullus
  alone, we will suffer the rare frailties of our coy lady, lest we may be
  too greatly unbearable, after the manner of fools. Often even Juno,
  greatest of heaven-dwellers, boiled with flaring wrath at her husband's
  default, wotting the host of frailties of all-wishful Jove. Yet 'tis not
  meet to match men with the gods, * * * * bear up the ungrateful burden of
  a tremulous parent. Yet she was not handed to me by a father's right hand
  when she came to my house fragrant with Assyrian odour, but she gave me
  her stealthy favours in the mute night, withdrawing of her own will from
  the bosom of her spouse. Wherefore that is enough if to us alone she
  gives that day which she <!-- Page 247 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page247"></a>[247]</span>marks with a whiter stone. This gift to
  thee, all that I can, of verse completed, is requital, Allius, for many
  offices, so that this day and that, and other and other of days may not
  tarnish your name with scabrous rust. Hither may the gods add gifts full
  many, which Themis aforetimes was wont to bear to the pious of old. May
  ye be happy, both thou and thy life's-love together, and thy home in
  which we have sported, and its mistress, and Anser who in the beginning
  brought thee to us, from whom all my good fortunes were first born, and
  lastly she whose very self is dearer to me than all these,&mdash;my
  light, whom living, 'tis sweet to me to live.</p>

  abused the holy assent of the gods in any pact, to work ill to men; great
  store of joys awaits thee during thy length of years, O Catullus, sprung
  from this ingrate love of thine. For whatever of benefit men can say or
  can do for anyone, such have been thy sayings and thy doings, and all thy
  confidences have been <!-- Page 268 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page268"></a>[268]</span>squandered on an ingrate mind. Wherefore
  now dost torture thyself further? Why not make firm thy heart and
  withdraw thyself from that [wretchedness], and cease to be unhappy
  despite the gods' will? 'Tis difficult quickly to depose a love of long
  growth; 'tis difficult, yet it behoves thee to do this. This is thine
  only salvation, this is thy great victory; this thou must do, whether it
  be possible or impossible. O gods, if 'tis in you to have mercy, or if
  ever ye held forth help to men in death's very extremity, look ye on
  pitiful me, and if I have acted my life with purity, snatch hence from me
  this canker and pest, which as a lethargy creeping through my veins and
  vitals, has cast out every gladness from my breast. Now I no longer pray
  that she may love me in return, or (what is not possible) that she should
  become chaste: I wish but for health and to cast aside this shameful
  complaint. O ye gods, vouchsafe me this in return for my probity.</p>

  <p>I snatched from thee, whilst thou wast sporting, O honied Juventius, a
  kiss sweeter than sweet ambrosia. But I bore it off not unpunished; for
  more than an hour do I remember myself hung on the summit of the cross,
  whilst I purged myself [for my crime] to thee, nor could any tears in the
  least remove your anger. For instantly it was done, thou didst bathe thy
  lips with many drops, and didst cleanse them with every finger-joint,
  lest anything remained from the conjoining of our mouths, as though it
  were the obscene slaver of a fetid fricatrice. Nay, more, thou hast
  handed wretched me over to despiteful Love, nor hast thou ceased to
  agonize me in every way, so that for me that kiss is now changed from
  ambrosia to be harsher than harsh hellebore. Since thou dost award such
  punishment to wretched amourist, never more after this will I steal
  kisses.</p>

<h3>NOTES</h3>

<p class="cenhead">EXPLANATORY AND ILLUSTRATIVE</p>

  <p>Carmen ii. <i>v.</i> 1. Politian, commenting on Catullus, held in
  common with Lampridius, Turnebus and Vossius that Lesbia's sparrow was an
  indecent allegory, like the "grey duck" in Pope's imitation of Chaucer.
  Sannazarius wrote an Epigram smartly castigating Politian, the closing
  lines of which were to the effect that the critic would like to devour
  the bird:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i12">Meus hic Pulicianus</p>
      <p>Tam bellum sibi passerem Catulli</p>
      <p>Intra viscera habere concupiscit.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Martial says:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Kiss me and I will give you Catullus's sparrow,</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>by which he does not mean a poem.</p>

  <p>And in the Apophoreta:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"If you have such a sparrow as Catullus's Lesbia deplored, it may
  lodge here."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Chaulieu has a similar Epigram:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Autant et plus que sa vie</p>
      <p>Phyllis aime un passereau;</p>
      <p>Ainsi la jeune Lesbie</p>
      <p>Jadis aima son moineau.</p>
      <p>Mais de celui de Catulle</p>
      <p>Se laissant aussi charmer,</p>
      <p>Dans sa cage, sans scrupule,</p>
      <p>Elle eut soin de l' enfermer.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Héguin de Guerle however sees nothing to justify this opinion,
  remarking that Catullus was not the man to use a <!-- Page 300 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page300"></a>[300]</span>veil of allegory in
  saying an indecency. "He preferred the bare, and even coarse, word; and
  he is too rich in this style of writing to need the loan of equivocal
  passages."</p>

  <p><i>v.</i> 12. The story of the race between Hippomenes and Atalanta,
  and how the crafty lover tricked the damsel into defeat by the three
  golden apples is well known. Cf. Ovid. Metam. lib. x. <i>v.</i> 560, et
  seq. According to Vossius the gift of an apple was equivalent to a
  promise of the last favour. The Emperor Theodosius caused Paulinus to be
  murdered for receiving an apple from his Empress. As to this, cf. the
  "Tale of the Three Apples," in <i>The Book of the Thousand Nights and a
  Night</i> (Sir Richard Burton's Translation, Benares, 1885-8, 16
  volumes), vol. i. p. 191. Cf. also note to C. lxv. <i>v.</i> 19.</p>

  <p><i>v.</i> 13. Virgins wore a girdle, generally of wool, for wool by
  the ancients was supposed to excite love, which the bridegroom the first
  night unbound in bed. Both in Greek and in Latin the phrase <i>to undo
  the zone</i> was used to signify the loss of virginity.</p>

  <p>C. vi. <i>v.</i> 8. Some say this is the spikenard, and the same with
  the Syrian <i>malobathrum</i>. But any rich odour was termed Syrian, by
  the Romans, who were extravagantly fond of perfumes; and used them,
  according to Vulpius, as provocatives to venery.</p>

  <p><i>v.</i> 9. <i>Pulvinus</i>, not <i>pulvinar</i>. Cf. carmen lxiiii.
  <i>v.</i> 47, post.</p>

  <p>C. vii. <i>v.</i> 6. Battus (in Libyan) Bahatus, a chief, a
  ruler.&mdash;Halevy Essai, p. 164.&mdash;<i>R. F. B.</i></p>

  <p>C. viii. <i>v.</i> 18. Plautus speaks of Teneris labellis molles
  morsiunculae. Thus too Horace:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i12">Sive puer furens</p>
      <p>Impressit memorem dente labris notam.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Or on thy lips the fierce fond boy</p>
      <p>Marks with his teeth the furious joy. <i>Francis</i>.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Plutarch tells us that Flora, the mistress of Cn. Pompey, used to say
  in commendation of her lover, that she could never quit his arms without
  giving him a bite. <!-- Page 301 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page301"></a>[301]</span></p>

  <p>C. xi. <i>v.</i> 5. In the Classics, Arabs always appear as a soft
  effeminate race; under primitive Christianity as heretics; and after the
  seventh century as conquerors, men of letters, philosophers, mediciners,
  magicians and alchemists.&mdash;<i>R. F. B.</i></p>

  <p><i>v.</i> 20. <i>Ilia rumpens</i>. More exactly rendered by
  Biacca:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i12">E sol di tutti</p>
      <p>Tenta l'iniqua ad isnervar i fianchi.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Guarini says of a coquette, that she likes to do with lovers as with
  gowns, have plenty of them, use one after another, and change them
  often.</p>

  <p>C. xiii. <i>v.</i> 9. I understand this, "Thou shalt depart after
  supper carrying with thee all our hearts."&mdash;<i>R. F. B.</i></p>

  <p>C. xiiii. <i>v.</i> 15. Whence our Christmas-day, the Winter Solstice
  connected with Christianity. There are only four universal
  festivals&mdash;"Holy days,"&mdash;and they are all of solar
  origin&mdash;The Solstices and the Equinoxes.&mdash;<i>R. F. B.</i></p>

  <p>C. xv. <i>v.</i> 7. The Etymology of "platea" shows it to be a street
  widening into a kind of <i>place</i>, as we often find in the old country
  towns of Southern Europe.&mdash;<i>R. F. B.</i></p>

  <p><i>v.</i> 18. <i>Patente porta</i>. This may be read "Your house door
  being open so that each passer may see your punishment," or it may be
  interpreted as referring to the punishment itself, <i>i.e.</i>, through
  the opened buttocks.</p>

  <p><i>v.</i> 19. This mode of punishing adulterers was first instituted
  amongst the Athenians. The victim being securely tied, a mullet was
  thrust up his fundament and withdrawn, the sharp gills of the fish
  causing excruciating torment to the sufferer during the process of its
  withdrawal, and grievously lacerating the bowels. Sometimes an enormous
  radish was substituted for the mullet. According to an epigram quoted by
  Vossius from the Anthologia, Alcaeus, the comic writer, died under this
  very punishment.</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Lo here Alcaeus sleeps; whom earth's green child,</p>
      <p>The broad-leaved radish, lust's avenger, kill'd.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>C. xvi. <i>v.</i> 1. <i>Paedicabo et irrumabo.</i> These detestable
  words are used here only as coarse forms of threatening, with no very
  definite meaning. It is certain that they were very <!-- Page 302
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page302"></a>[302]</span>commonly
  employed in this way, with no more distinct reference to their original
  import than the corresponding phrases of the modern Italians, <i>T' ho in
  culo</i> and <i>becco fottuto</i>, or certain brutal exclamations common
  in the mouths of the English vulgar.</p>

  <p><i>v.</i> 5. Ovid has a distich to the same effect:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Crede mihi, distant mores a carmine nostri;</p>
      <p>Vita verecunda est, musa jocosa mihi.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>"Believe me there is a vast difference between my morals and my song;
  my life is decorous, my muse is wanton." And Martial says:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Lasciva est nobis pagina, vita proba est.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Which is thus translated by Maynard:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Si ma plume est une putain,</p>
      <p class="i2">Ma vie est une sainte.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Pliny quotes this poem of Catullus to excuse the wantonness of his own
  verses, which he is sending to his friend Paternus; and Apuleius cites
  the passage in his Apology for the same purpose. "Whoever," says Lambe,
  "would see the subject fully discussed, should turn to the Essay on the
  Literary Character by Mr. Disraeli." He enumerates as instances of free
  writers who have led pure lives, La Motte le Vayer, Bayle, la Fontaine,
  Smollet, and Cowley. "The imagination," he adds, "may be a volcano, while
  the heart is an Alp of ice." It would, however, be difficult to enlarge
  this list, while on the other hand, the catalogue of those who really
  practised the licentiousness they celebrated, would be very numerous. One
  period alone, the reign of Charles the Second, would furnish more than
  enough to outnumber the above small phalanx of purity. Muretus, whose
  poems clearly gave him every right to knowledge on the subject, but whose
  known debauchery would certainly have forbidden any credit to accrue to
  himself from establishing the general purity of lascivious poets, at once
  rejects the probability of such a contrast, saying:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Quisquis versibus exprimit Catullum</p>
      <p>Raro moribus exprimit Catonem.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>"One who is a Catullus in verse, is rarely a Cato in morals." <!--
  Page 303 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page303"></a>[303]</span></p>

  <p>C. xviii. This and the two following poems are found in the Catalecta
  of Vergilius, but they are assigned to Catullus by many of the best
  critics, chiefly on the authority of Terentianus Maurus.</p>

  <p><i>v.</i> 2. Cf. <i>Auct. Priapeiorum</i>, Eps. lv. <i>v.</i> 6, and
  lxxvii. <i>v.</i> 15.</p>

  <p><i>v.</i> 3. <i>Ostreosior</i>. This Epithet, peculiarly Catullian, is
  appropriate to the coasts most favoured by Priapus; oysters being an
  incentive to lust.</p>

  <p>C. xx. <i>v.</i> 19. The traveller mocks at Priapus' threat of sodomy,
  regarding it as a pleasure instead of as a punishment. The god, in anger,
  retorts that if that punishment has no fears for him, a fustigation by
  the farmer with the self-same mentule used as a cudgel may have a more
  deterrent effect. Cf. <i>Auct. Priap.</i> Ep. li. <i>v.</i> 27, 28:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Nimirum apertam convolatis ad poenam:</p>
      <p>Et vos hoc ipsum, quod minamur, invitat.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Without doubt, ye flock to the open punishment [so called because the
  natural parts of Priapus were always exposed to view], and the very thing
  with which I threaten, allures you.</p>

  <p>And also Ep. lxiv.,</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i2">Quidam mollior anseris medulla,</p>
      <p class="i2">Furatum venit hoc amor poenae.</p>
      <p class="i2">Furetur licet usque non videbo.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>One than a goose's marrow softer far,</p>
      <p>Comes hither stealing for it's penalty sake;</p>
      <p>Steal he as please him: I will see him not.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>C. xxiii. <i>v.</i> 6. Dry and meagre as wood; like the woman of whom
  Scarron says, that she never snuffed the candle with her fingers for fear
  of setting them on fire.</p>

  <p>C. xxv. <i>v.</i> 1. Cf. Auct. Priap. Ep. xlv.</p>

  <p><i>v.</i> 5. This is a Catullian <i>crux</i>. Mr. Arthur Palmer
  (Trinity College, Dublin, Jan. 31, 1890) proposes, and we
  adopt&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">

    <div class="stanza">

    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Diva miluorum is&mdash;Diva furum, Goddess of thieves; <i>i.e.</i>,
  Laverna Milvus (hawk) being generally used for a rapacious <!-- Page 304
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page304"></a>[304]</span>robber. Mr.
  Palmer quotes Plaut. (Poen. 5, 5, 13; Pers. 3, 4, 5; Bacch. 2, 3, 40),
  and others.&mdash;<i>R. F. B.</i></p>

  <p><i>v.</i> 6. <i>Involasti</i>, thou didst swoop&mdash;still metaphor
  of the prey-bird.&mdash;<i>R. F. B.</i></p>

  <p>C. xxvi. <i>v.</i> 3. Still the "Bora" of the Adriatic, extending,
  with intervals, from Trieste to Bari. It is a N.N. Easter of peculiar
  electrical properties, causing extreme thirst, wrecking ships, upsetting
  mail-trains, and sweeping carriages and horses into the sea. Austral, the
  south wind, is represented in these days by the Scirocco, S.S.E. It sets
  out from Africa a dry wind, becomes supersaturated in the Mediterranean,
  and is the scourge of Southern Italy, exhausting the air of ozone and
  depressing the spirits and making man utterly useless and
  miserable.&mdash;<i>R. F. B.</i></p>

  <p>C. xxviii. <i>v.</i> 10. These expressions, like those in carmen xvi.
  ante, are merely terms of realistically gross abuse.</p>

  <p>C. xxviiii. <i>v.</i> 5. <i>Cinaede Romule</i>. The epithet is here
  applied in its grossest sense, which again is implied in the allusion to
  the spoil of Pontus; for this, as Vossius proves, can only be understood
  to mean the wealth obtained by Caesar, when a young man, through his
  infamous relations with Nicomedes, king of Pontus&mdash;as witness two
  lines sung by Caesar's own soldiers on the occasion of his triumph:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Ecce Caesar nunc triumphat, qui subegit Galliam;</p>
      <p>Nicomedes non triumphat, qui subegit Caesarem.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p><i>v.</i> 13. <i>Defututa Mentula</i> = a worn-out voluptuary. Mentula
  is a cant term which Catullus frequently uses for a libidinous person,
  and particularly for Mamurra.</p>

  <p><i>v.</i> 24. Pompey married Caesar's daughter, Julia, and is commonly
  supposed to be the "son-in-law" here meant; but Vossius argues with some
  force, that <i>socer</i> and <i>gener</i> apply, not to Caesar and
  Pompey, but to Caesar and Mamurra. Those words, and the corresponding
  terms in Greek, were often used in an unnatural sense, as for instance in
  an epigram on Noctuinus, attributed to Calvus, in which occurs this very
  line, <i>Gener socerque perdidistis omnia</i>. <!-- Page 305 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page305"></a>[305]</span></p>

  <p>C. xxxi. <i>v.</i> 1. As the Venice-Trieste railway runs along the
  southern bar of the pyriform narrow, Lago di Garda, with its towering
  mountains, whose heads are usually in the storm-clouds, and whose feet
  sink into the nearest vineyards, the traveller catches a sight of the
  Sirmio Spit, long and sandy. It is a narrow ridge boldly projecting into
  the lake (once called Benacus) which was formerly a marsh, but now made
  into an island by the simple process of ditch cutting: at the southern
  end is the Sermione hill and its picturesque Scottish-German Castle. To
  the north are some ruins supposed to be the old Villa of Catullus, but
  they seem too extensive to serve for the purpose.&mdash;<i>R. F.
  B.</i></p>

  <p>C. xxxii. <i>v.</i> 11. Pezay, a French translator, strangely mistakes
  the meaning of the passage, as if it amounted to this, "I have gorged
  till I am ready to burst;" and he quotes the remark of "une femme
  charmante," who said that her only reply to such a billet-doux would have
  been to send the writer an emetic. But the lady might have prescribed a
  different remedy if she had been acquainted with Martial's line:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>O quoties rigidâ pulsabis pallia venâ!</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>or with this quatrain of an old French poet:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Ainsi depuis une semaine</p>
      <p>La longue roideur de ma veine,</p>
      <p>Pour néant rouge et bien en point,</p>
      <p>Bat ma chemise et mon pourpoint.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>C. xxxvii. <i>v.</i> 1. Taverns and Wine-shops in Rome were
  distinguished by pillars projecting into the streets, the better to catch
  the eye of the passenger, as sign-posts of inns do with us now; the
  tavern in question was a house of ill-fame, and we are told it was the
  ninth column or sign-post from the Temple of Castor and Pollux.</p>

  <p><i>v.</i> 2. It was customary to display on the fronts of brothels the
  names of the inmates, just as shopkeepers' names were inscribed over
  places of more reputable trade: this was called <i>inscriptio</i> or
  <i>titulus</i>.</p>

  <p><i>v.</i> 10. <i>Scorpionibus</i>. Indecent inscriptions scribbled on
  the walls and door with burnt sticks. <!-- Page 306 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page306"></a>[306]</span></p>

  <p><i>v.</i> 11. Catullus's mistress had, it seems, run away from him to
  a common brothel, in front of which it was the custom, not only for women
  but even for men, to sit down and offer themselves for prostitution.</p>

  <p><i>v.</i> 16. <i>Semitarii moechi</i>. Whoremongers who take up with
  common women who offer themselves at every corner of the streets for a
  mere trifle.</p>

  <p><i>v.</i> 20. <i>Hibera Urina</i>. We are assured by Strabo,
  <i>Lib.</i> 3, that this filthy custom prevailed greatly in Spain: teeth
  were not only washed in stale urine, the acid of which must necessarily
  render them white, but they were also rubbed with a powder of calcined
  human excrement. Persons sometimes even bathed their whole bodies in
  urine.</p>

  <p>C. xxxxi. <i>v.</i> 3. <i>Turpiculo naso</i>. The kind of nose alluded
  to is such as sheep or goats have. Cf. Lucretius, <i>lib.</i> iv. v.
  1152.</p>

  <p>C. xxxxvii. <i>v.</i> 6. <i>In trivio</i>, i.e., in the most public
  places, in hopes of finding some host.</p>

  <p><i>v.</i> 7. This hunting for invitations does not, according to
  modern notions, place the two friends of Catullus in a respectable light;
  but it was a common and avowed practice at Rome.</p>

  <p>C. liii. <i>v.</i> 5. <i>Salaputium</i>. A pet name for the male
  virile member. This word has been the subject of much debate among the
  learned. Some read <i>solopachium</i>, meaning a "mannikin eighteen
  inches high"; Saumasius proposes salopygium, a "wagtail"; several editors
  have <i>salaputium</i>, an indelicate word nurses used to children when
  they fondled them, so that the exclamation would mean, "what a learned
  little puppet!" Thus Augustus called Horace <i>purissimum penem</i>.</p>

  <p>C. liiii. I find it an impossibility to make any sense out of this
  poem.</p>

  <p><i>v.</i> 5. <i>Seni recocto</i>. Horace applies this epithet to one
  who has served the office of <i>quinquevir</i>, or proconsul's notary,
  and who was therefore master of all the arts of chicanery. These are his
  words, Sat. v. lib. 2:</p>

  <p>The modern Italians say of a man of this stamp, <i>Egli ha cotto il
  culo ne' ceci rossi</i>. The phrase <i>seni recocto</i> may imply one who
  enjoys a green and vigorous old age, as if made young again, as the old
  woman was by wine, of whom Petronius speaks, <i>Anus recocta vino</i>; or
  Æson, who was re-cooked by Medaea. That witch, says Valerius Flaccus,
  <i>Recoquit fessos aetate parentes</i>.</p>

  <p>C. lvi. <i>v.</i> 6. <i>Trusantem</i>. Many read <i>crissantem</i>,
  which means the movement of the loins in women; <i>ceventem</i> being the
  like of a man. As the expression refers to the lad, <i>crissantem</i>
  cannot be correct.</p>

  <p><i>v.</i> 7. <i>Pro telo</i>. Alluding to the custom of punishing
  adulterers by transfixing them with darts. The double-entendre of
  <i>Telo</i> with <i>Mentula</i> is evident, and makes clear the apology
  to Venus. See <i>lib.</i> 9 of Apuleius for a similar passage.</p>

  <p>C. lvii. <i>v.</i> 7. <i>Erudituli</i>. The accomplishments alluded to
  are not literary, but Priapeian. It is in this sense Petronius calls Gito
  <i>doctissimus puer</i>. &OElig;zema, a grave German jurist, parodied a
  part of this piece. His epigram can be read without danger of having
  one's stomach turned.</p>

  Rufus, Catullus's rival in the affections of Lesbia, or Clodia, according
  to Achilles Statius; Plutarch calls her Quadrantaria; she was debauched
  by her own brother, Publius Clodius; afterwards she became the mistress
  of Catullus, and lastly the common strumpet of Rome. <!-- Page 308

  <p><i>v.</i> 4. The meanest trulls frequented the public streets.</p>

  <p><i>v.</i> 5. <i>Glubit</i>. <i>Glubo</i> = to husk (corn), hence it is
  tropically used to denote masturbation. Cf. Ausonius, epigram 71.</p>

  <p>C. lviiii. <i>v.</i> 1. <i>Fellat</i>. This refers to the complacent
  use by the female of her lips in the act of connection.</p>

  <p><i>v.</i> 3. The half-starved women of pleasure attended at funerals
  in the hope of picking up parts of the viands which were laid on the pile
  and burnt with the body.</p>

  <p>C. lxi. <i>v.</i> 22. <i>Myrtus Asia</i>. The Asia of Catullus was
  that marshy tract of land near Mount Tmolus and the River Caystrus. Cf.
  Homer (<i>Il.</i> ii. 461) for the "Ancient Meadow." It was said to be as
  famous for its myrtles as for its cranes. Proper "Asia Minor" is the
  title first used by Oratius (Orazius?) (1. 2.) in the IVth century. See
  the "Life and Works of St. Paul," by Dr. Farrar (i. 465).&mdash;<i>R. F.
  B.</i></p>

  <p><i>v.</i> 54. <i>Timens</i>. Many more obscenely write <i>tumens</i>,
  thus changing the "fear-full" bridegroom into the "swollen"
  bridegroom.</p>

  <p><i>v.</i> 123. It was usual for the mirthful friends of the newly
  married couple to sing obscene songs called <i>Fescennine</i>, which were
  tolerated on this occasion.</p>

  <p><i>v.</i> 124. <i>Nec nuces pueris</i>. This custom of throwing nuts,
  such as walnuts or almonds, is of Athenian origin; some say it was meant
  to divert the attention from the raptures of the bride and bridegroom,
  when in bed, by the noise they, and the scrambling boys, made on the
  floor. For <i>nuces</i>, referring to the use of boys, see Verg. Eclogue
  8.</p>

  <p><i>v.</i> 125. <i>Concubinus</i>. By the shamelessness of this
  passage, it would seem to be quite a usual thing amongst the youthful
  Roman aristocracy to possess a bedfellow of their own sex.</p>

  <p><i>v.</i> 137. "This coarse imitation of the Fescennine poems," says
  Dunlop (History of Roman Literature), "leaves on our minds a stronger
  impression of the prevalence and extent of Roman vices than any other
  passage in the Latin classics. Martial, and Catullus himself elsewhere,
  have branded their enemies; and Juvenal, in bursts of satiric <!-- Page
  309 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page309"></a>[309]</span>indignation, has reproached his countrymen
  with the blackest crimes. But here, in a complimentary poem to a patron
  and intimate friend, these are jocularly alluded to as the venial
  indulgence of his earliest youth."</p>

  Spenser, Faery Queen, b. ii. c. 12:</p>

  <p>C. lxiii. <i>v.</i> 23. Women devoted to the service of Bacchus or of
  Cybele; for many things were common to the rights of both deities. The
  name is derived from <span title="mainesthai" class="grk"
  >&mu;&alpha;&iota;&nu;&epsilon;&sigma;&theta;&alpha;&iota;</span>, to
  rave.</p>

  <p><i>v.</i> 28. <i>Thiasus</i> is properly a chorus of sacred singers
  and dancers, living in a community, like a college of dervishes, who,
  indeed, are an exact counterpart of the Galli as regards their howling
  and dancing ritual, but have the advantage of their predecessors in one
  important particular, <i>i.e.</i>, they are not castrated.</p>

  <p>C. lxiiii. <i>v.</i> 65. The strophium was a band which confined the
  breasts and restrained the exuberance of their growth. Martial
  apostrophizes it thus:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Fascia, crescentes dominae compesce papillas,</p>
      <p>Ut sit quod capiat nostra tegatque manus.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>"Confine the growth of my fair one's breasts, that they may be just
  large enough for my hand to enclose them." <!-- Page 310 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page310"></a>[310]</span></p>

  <p><i>v.</i> 377. <i>Circumdare filo</i>. That is, may you to-morrow
  prove that you are no longer a virgin; for the ancients had an idea that
  the neck swelled after venery; perhaps from the supposed descent of the
  procreative fluid which they thought lodged in the brain. See Hippocrates
  and Aristotle upon this subject. The swelling of the bride's neck was
  therefore ascertained by measurement with a thread on the morning after
  the nuptials, and was held to be sufficient proof of their happy
  consummation. The ancients, says Pezay, had faith in another equally
  absurd test of virginity. They measured the circumference of the neck
  with a thread. Then the girl under trial took the two ends of the magic
  thread in her teeth, and if it was found to be so long that its bight
  could be passed over her head, it was clear she was not a maid. By this
  rule all the thin girls might pass for vestals, and all the plump ones
  for the reverse.</p>

  <p><i>v.</i> 403. Semiramis is said to have done thus by her son
  Ninus.</p>

  <p>C. lxv. <i>v.</i> 19. The gift of an apple had a very tender meaning;
  according to Vossius it was <i>quasi pignus concubitus</i>, that is to
  say, it was the climax</p>

  <p>In one of the love epistles of Aristaenetus, Phalaris complains to her
  friend Petala, how her younger sister, who had accompanied her to dine
  with Pamphilus, her lover, attempted to seduce him, and among other
  wanton tricks did as follows: "Pamphilus, biting off a piece of an apple,
  chucked it dexterously into her bosom; she took it, kissed it, and
  thrusting it under her sash, hid it between her breasts." Cf. note to C.
  ii. <i>v.</i> 12, <i>ante.</i></p>

  <p>C. lxvii. <i>v.</i> 21. <i>Languidior</i>. This expression, here
  obscenely applied, is proverbial, from the flagging of the leaves of the
  beet; hence the Latin word <i>batizare</i>, to droop, used by Suetonius,
  <i>in Augusto</i>. See Pliny on this plant, Cap. xiii. <i>lib.</i> 9.</p>

  <p><i>v.</i> 28. <i>Zonam Solvere</i>. See the note to C. ii. <i>v.</i>
  13.</p>

  <p><i>v.</i> 30. <i>Minxerit in gremium</i>. Horace uses the word
  <i>mingere</i> in the same sense:</p>

  <p>C. lxviiii. <i>v.</i> 6. <i>Sub alarum</i>. Many would join these two
  words and form one, which, however, is not authorised by any ancient
  writer. The Spaniards, it is true, say <i>sobaco</i>, the armpit, but
  this does not justify a new Latin coinage of any similar word. The smell
  alluded to in this line has often been compared to that of a goat; it is
  called <i>capram</i>, <i>caprum</i>, and <i>hircam</i>. Thus Horace,
  Epod. 12,</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i16"><i>Namque sagacius unus odoror</i></p>

  </div>
  <p>This tetterous complaint is peculiar to warm countries; we know
  scarcely anything of it in our northern climate.</p>

  <p>C. lxxiiii. <i>v.</i> 6. The reader will easily guess that one reason
  for the uncle's inability to murmur was owing to the occupation which
  Gellius had thrust on him.</p>

  <p>C. lxxvii. <i>v.</i> 8. <i>Suavia comminxit</i>. This habit, which the
  filthy Rufus adopts, is mentioned by Lucretius:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i16"><i>Jungunt salivas</i></p>

  <p>C. lxxxviiii. <i>v.</i> 1. The good condition and number of the

  <p>C. lxxxx. <i>v.</i> 6. <i>Omentum</i>. The sages used to draw omens
  from the entrails of sacrificed beasts as they were burning; but more
  particularly from the <i>omentum</i>, or <i>caul</i>, that apron of fat
  which covers the abdominal viscera.</p>

  <p>C. lxxxxiiii. <i>v.</i> 1. There is a double meaning in the original,
  and the translator can give but half of it. <i>Mentula</i>, synonymous
  with <i>penis</i>, is a nickname applied by Catullus to Mamurra, of whom
  he says (cxv.) that he is not a man, but a great thundering
  <i>mentula</i>. Mahérault has happily rendered the meaning of the epigram
  in French, in which language there is an equivalent for Mentula, that is
  to say, a man's name which is also a popular synonym for what
  characterizes the god Priapus. "Jean Chouard fornique; eh! sans doute,
  c'est bien Jean Chouard. C'est ainsi qu'on peut dire que c'est la marmite
  qui cueille les choux." Achilles Statius interprets this <i>distich</i>
  thus, "It is the flesh that is guilty, and not I who am guilty; so is it
  the pot that robs the garden, and not the thief that robs the
  pot-herbs."</p>

  <p><i>v.</i> 2. <i>Ipsa olera olla legat</i>. This may have been a cant
  proverb of the day containing a meaning which is now unknown to us.
  Parthenius interprets it "A libidinous man is apt in adultery, as a
  vessel is suited to hold its contents."</p>

  <p>C. lxxxxvii. <i>v.</i> 1. There is in the Greek Anthology a similar
  epigram by Nicarchus, which has thus been translated by Grotius:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Non culo, Theodore, minus tibi foetida bucca est</p>
      <p class="i2">Noscera discrimen sit sapientis opus.</p>
      <p>Scribere debueras hîc podex est meus, hic os;</p>
      <p class="i2">Nunc tu cum pedas atque loquare simul,</p>
      <p>Discere non valeo, quid venerit inde vel inde;</p>
      <p class="i2">Vipera namque infra sibilat atque supra.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p><i>v.</i> 7. Few are ignorant of what Scaliger here gravely tells us:
  <i>fessi muli strigare solent, ut meiant</i>. Vossius reads
  <i>defissus</i>, in a different sense. <!-- Page 313 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page313"></a>[313]</span></p>

  <p>C. lxxxxviiii. This poem shews beyond contradiction that Catullus
  himself was not free from the vice of paederasty, so universal amongst
  the Roman youth.</p>

  <p><i>v.</i> 10. <i>Lupae</i>. The infamous, fetid harlot is called
  <i>lupa</i> (a she-wolf) from the ravenousness of the wolf answering to
  the rapacious disposition of the generality of courtezans: but Servius,
  <i>Aen.</i> 3, assigns a much more improper and filthy reason.</p>

  <p>C. c. <i>v.</i> 1. Again the Roman paederasty shews itself in
  Caelius's affection for Aufilenus.</p>

  <p>C. ciii. It appears that Catullus had given a sum of money to the
  pander Silo to procure him a mistress. He did not perform his engagement,
  but kept the money, and abused our sinning bard when he reproached him
  with the cheat.</p>

  <p>C. cv. There are not wanting commentators who give a very obscene turn
  to this epigram against Mamurra.</p>

  <p>C. cx. <i>v.</i> 4. The word <i>dare</i> has here an erotic sense.</p>

  <p><i>v.</i> 8. <i>Tota corpore prostituit</i>. Some commentators think
  that this alludes to such women as not only submit to prostitution, but
  are in every way subservient to the lascivious caprices of depraved
  appetites. Vossius inclines to such an interpretation.</p>

  <p>C. cxii. <i>v.</i> 2. <i>Multus</i>. Some commentators read
  <i>moltus</i> in an obscene sense, <i>à molendo</i>. Vossius understands
  by <i>descendere in sese</i> the same act as is alluded to in C.
  lxxxviii., hence the force of the word <i>multus</i>, meaning <i>cum
  feminâ</i>, which he jeeringly applies to Naso as though he would
  ironically exclaim: <i>Et tu feminâ! tu solus es, aut sine feminâ</i>. He
  writes the epigram thus:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p><i>Multus homo est, Naso, neque secum multus homo qui</i></p>
      <p><i>Descendit? Naso, multus es et pathicus?</i></p>
